## Dialogue
A:  Charlie, do you have a second? 

B:  Yeah what's up? 

A:  Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me your half. 

B:  Yeah I wanted to talk to you about that. I agreed we would go halves on allthe bills, but frankly I think it's unfair. 

A:  Unfair! Why? 

B:  Well, you have long hair and use the hairdryer every morning. I don't. You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents. I don't. You see what I'm getting at here? 

A:  You leave the air conditioner on day and night! You also take 30 minute showers which means you are using way more gas and water than me! 

B:  Well, while we are at it, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend. You always leave a mess and keep me up all night! 

A:  Maybe you should just move out and find another place. 

B:  Maybe you should move out!
