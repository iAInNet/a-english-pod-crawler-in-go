## Dialogue
A:  Ugg, this bathroom is a pigsty!

B:  Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet? What's wrong?

A:  I just can't stand it. It's really gross in here! There's a stain on the toilet seat, and the floor was wet and slippery. So I cleaned it!

B:  You did what? Helen, I know it's gross, but I've seen many public washrooms that are much worse. Why are you cleaning the counter top? are you out of your mind?

A:  I can't help myself; it's just so disgusting in here!

B:  Helen, this is not like your own bathroom. Just leave it to the cleaners,okay?

A:  Hang on. I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.

B:  You're such a neat freak! I'm outta here!
