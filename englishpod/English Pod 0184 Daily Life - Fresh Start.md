## Dialogue
A:  Now that it's the new year, I've decided to turn over a new leaf.  

B:  Yeah? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean? 

A:  You got it! I have a new job, I'm living in a new city, with new friends! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life. 

B:  So what are you going to do? Take up an art class or something? 

A:  Well, first of all, I've decided to stop smoking. It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything, it's just that I've been smoking since I was sixteen, and I think it's time to stop. 

B:  I'm with you on that one. Anything else you're planning on doing? 

A:  One last thing, I've decided to come out of the closet. 

B:  It's about time!
