## Dialogue
Mr. Parsons:  Right Rebecca. Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was....... 

Rebecca:  For a local paper in York called the York Herald. Actually, I started with them as an intern in the beginning. I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalistic world, and this seemed like a good first step. 

Mr. Parsons:  Certainly. And after your internship 

Rebecca:  They seemed impressed, and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter. I ended up staying two years there actually. I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper. I really enjoyed it there, and it really helped me build my skills. 

Mr. Parsons:  Yes I see. But you decided to leave them in 2006 right

Rebecca:  Yes, that's right. My husband and I moved to London, and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London 

Mr. Parsons:  The London Weekly right 

Rebecca:  Yes, in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.
