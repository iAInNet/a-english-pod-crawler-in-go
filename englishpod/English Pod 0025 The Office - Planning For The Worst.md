## Dialogue
A:  Well, right, let’s move to our next    order of business,  as many of you are aware, in recent weeks there has been   a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue.  And it's come to my attention  that our company lacks any sort of   bird flu  c

B:  Basically, we need to come up with   a clear plan; we need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case a pandemic  strikes.

A:  So, what I’d  like to do   is: first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan; Ralph, I’d like you to head up  this project.

C:  Sure, no problem.    What issues do you want me to consider?

B:  Well, let’s see,    there are  a few    points    we need  to be thinking  about...    first, I’ll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact an outbreak might have.

A:  You’ll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected; think of ways to reduce  employee-customer contact,   perhaps some IT solutions  that will allow  our people to work from home.

C:  I guess you’ll need me to forecast  employee absences as well,   right?  And I’ll think about the impact this will have  on our clients.  Hey, what about vaccines?  Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees?

A:  Exactly right. So, I’ll leave this to you,   and we’ll review the draft plan in two weeks.  Okay, so, anyone want to order  some KFC for lunch?
