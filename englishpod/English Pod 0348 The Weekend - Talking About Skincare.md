## Dialogue
A:  You want to go get a facial with me today?

B:  Dude, what are you talking about?  Only girls do that.

A:  Not at all, guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures.  There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

B:  True. So what do they do to you at your beauty spa?

A:  Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.  Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young.  Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

B:  That doesn’t really sound like something I would be interested in.  In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.

A:  Well you should come with me one day, I’m sure you’ll love it.

B:  Uh... no.
