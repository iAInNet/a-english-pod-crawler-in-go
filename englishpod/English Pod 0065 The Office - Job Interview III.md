## Dialogue
A:  Very good. Now,   I have a couple of final questions.

B:  I hope they're not too hard!

A:  Well, why should we hire you?

B:  I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.  I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen, and outstanding soft skills; you know, I excel at building strong, long-term customer relationships. For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team  solved about  seventy percent of our customers' problems.  I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products, so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers' issues.  Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

A:  Impressive! So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

B:  To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management. Punctuality has never been a strength of mine. I find it hard to organize my time efficiently.  I have actually addressed this weakness recently, by attending a workshop on efficient time management. It helped me a lot, by providing me with great insights on how   to get organized  and use my time efficiently, so I think I'm getting better now.

A:  Great...  Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview. We are short-listing our candidates this week, and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.

B:  Great,   thanks a lot! I hope to hear from you! Good bye.
