## Dialogue
Gulam:  Steven! Good to see you brother! How are you?  How was your trip?

Steven:  It was fine. I've been better but, it's great to be home, I've missed you all!  How's mom?

Gulam:  She's great! All she ever does is talk about you -her little boy that went to the United States.  You're her pride and joy, you know that?

Steven:  Can't wait to see her.  And you?  What's new with you?

Gulam:  Well, Nisha and I are expecting! You'll have another nephew or niece soon!

Steven:  That's great! Wow! Congrats! You two are great together, ya know.  You have such a beautiful family.  I hope one day I can have that.

Gulam:  Of course, man! Come on!  I mean, everything was set here for you to marry Shalini! You know, she's still pining after you.  I don't think she'll ever get over you.

Steven:  What are you talking about?  I hardly knew her! How could she be in love with me?  I couldn't go through with it even though she is a great woman.  No, I left my heart in the United States. I just hope Veronica is happy.

Gulam:  Get over it! You're home now.  Everyone here thinks so highly of you; there'll be girls throwing themselves at you.  You can marry anyone you want!

Steven:  I don't want to marry anyone! I want to marry her! Don't you understand?

Gulam:  You are incorrigible.

Liliana:  Steven!  My baby how are you! I've missed you so much!

Steven:  Hey, mom! Great to see you!

Liliana:  You look so thin! Didn't those Americans feed you? Come come, let's have some chai.  By the way... There is a girl here waiting for you.

Veronica:  Hi Steven.

Steven:  Veronica! How did you get here? How did you know where I live?  I waited for you at the airport but you never showed...

Veronica:  I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about, but we can discuss that later.   I realized that I was just scared.  Scared of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires.  I'm here now.  Now there is something I wanna ask you.  Steven, will you marry me?

Priest:  I now declare you, husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.
