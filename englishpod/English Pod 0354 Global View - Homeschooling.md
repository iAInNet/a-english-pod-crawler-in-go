## Dialogue
A:  I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids. 

B:  What? Why? 

A:  Well, our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive. I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages. 

B:  Like what? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction. 

A:  Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way. I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses. 

B:  I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.

A:  I will bring it up over Sunday brunch. 

B:  Good luck with that!
