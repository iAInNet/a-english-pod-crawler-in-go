## Dialogue
A:  It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men's Volleyball world championship.   My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man with the plan,   Bob Copeland.

B:  Thank you, Rick. We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round. Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match.

A:  The ref signals the start of the game and here we go. Ribeiro serves and China quickly receives the ball.  Chen bumps it to the setter, and... a very nice set by Chen!

B:  Xu   spikes it! Wow, what a great hit! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but   he managed to get the ball in! Great play.

A:  It's China's service now. What a superb jump serve   by Li, oh, and we have a let serve. The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.

B:  Brazil calls for a time out and we'll be right back, after a short commercial break.
