## Dialogue
A:  Valerie! Hi! Wow how are you?  It's been such a long time!

B:  Darlene! Indeed, it's been a while! How have you been? Wow, you look amazing! I love what you've done with your hair!

A:  Really? Thanks! I went to that hair salon that you told me about, but enough about me! Look at you! You haven't aged a day since the last time I saw you! What is your secret!

B:  Ha ha, come on! Well, I've been watching what I eat, and working out three times a week.  By the way, I heard your son recently graduated!

A:  Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor. They grow up so fast you know.

B:  He is such a handsome guy.  He gets his looks from his mother of course!

A:  Thank you! What about your daughter, Pamela?  I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently.

B:  Oh yes. She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended.

A:  Such a lovely girl.  I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday!

B:  But of course! Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

A:  Same here! We will catch up soon, maybe over coffee!

B:  That would be great!  Give me a call!

A:  See you soon!  Bye!   Ugg... I can't stand that woman or her obnoxious son.
