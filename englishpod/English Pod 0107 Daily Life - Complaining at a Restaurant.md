## Dialogue
A:  Excuse me, waiter? Waiter!

B:  Yes, sir? What can I do for you?

A:  I've been sitting here for the past twenty minutes and no one has offered me a glass of water, brought any bread to the table and our appetizers haven't been served yet! You know, in this kind of establishment, I'd expect much better service.

B:  I am sorry, sir. I'll check on your order right away.

C:  Relax honey, the place is busy tonight, but I've heard the food is amazing. Anyway...

B:  Here you are, sir. The foie gras for the lady, and a mushroom soup for you.

A:  Waiter, I ordered a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus.  This soup is obviously too runny, and it's over-seasoned.  It's completely inedible!

B:  Okay, I do apologize for that.  Can I bring you another soup, or would you like to order something else?

A:  Take this foie gras back as well, it's rubbery and completely overcooked.  And look at the portion size!  How can you charge twenty-five dollars for a sliver of duck liver?

B:  Right away... sir.

C:  Honey come on! The foie gras was fine,  why are you making such a big deal? Are you trying to get our meal comped again?

A:  What do you mean? We are paying for this. If I'm shelling out my hard earned bucks, I expect value for money!

B:  Here you are, sir.  I hope it is alright now. The chef has prepared it specially for you.

A:  Yes, fine.

C:  Honey, are you alright?
