## Dialogue
A:  What’s for dinner?

B:  Leftovers.

A:  What?  Leftovers of what and from when?

B:  From last night!  I took the left over turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches!

A:  Isn’t that dangerous though?  I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or reheated?

B:  Well, I didn’t leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating. Also, when reheating, I put it inthe oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius. 

A:  Well ok, I am just afraid of getting food poisoning.

B:  Don’t worry about it!  Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art!  Not only do you save money, but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat!
