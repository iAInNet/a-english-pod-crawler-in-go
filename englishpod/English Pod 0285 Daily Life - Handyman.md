## Dialogue
A:  The air conditioning is not working! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here! 

B:  Dan is on top of that. I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up. 

A:  That would be convenient. They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring. The circuit breakers keep going out all the time. It’s really annoying! 

B:  Yeah you are right. This office is falling apart! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that’s why the parking lot was flooded. 

A:  I know! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.
