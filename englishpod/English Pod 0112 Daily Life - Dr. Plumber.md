## Dialogue
A:  Good afternoon! Did you call for a plumber?

B:  Yes, yes I did.  Please come in! I'm so glad you came! This old house is falling apart!  Come on into the bathroom.  See, here, there's water leaking everywhere!

A:  I see. Let me have a look. It seems that your toilet is clogged, and that's why it won't flush.  Let me just get my plunger.  No, that's not working either.   I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipes that's causing a blockage.  That's what's making your toilet overflow.

B:  Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter. She is always flushing things down the toilet. You know how kids are.

A:  Yeah, I have a little one myself.  Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. That could be causing water to not drain completely; that might lead to more problems in the future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.  I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

B:  That would be great! Is it expensive?

A:  Let's see... I would say about eight hundred dollars.

B:  What? That's more than I make in a day and I'm a heart surgeon!
