## Dialogue
A:  Hey Joe! Where have you been these past few days? 

B:  I've been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross. 

A:  Cool! I've always wanted to do something like that! Have you learned anything useful?  

B:  For sure! I mean we've learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to check for a pulse, and even how to apply CPR! 

A:  Have you treated any real emergencies? 

B:  Well, they took us along with some paramedics. There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures. His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital. It was intense! 

A:  I can imagine! I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't be taking up a course like that anytime soon!
