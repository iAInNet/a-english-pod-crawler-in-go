## Dialogue
A:  Isn't this great? I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food! 

B:  This is very beautiful. Though I have to confess, I don't know  the first thing about farming! 

A:  That's fine! Don't worry about it! 

B:  What was that? 

A:  Relax, it was just a goat! 

B:  And that? 

A:  It's just the cows that are grazing over there. We can milk them later. 

B:  What was that? 

A:  Honey, seriously, It's just a sheep. Relax! 

A:  Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . 

B:  You know  what? I don't think I can hack it here out in the countryside. I'm going back to the city!
