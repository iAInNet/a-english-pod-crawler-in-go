## Dialogue
Jim:  Argh...I feel terrible, I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery, what’s wrong with me?

Tom:  Wow, you’re not dying are you, it looks like you have a cold, you should take some medicine.

Jim:  I  don’t think it’s a cold, I feel  fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.

Tom:  Maybe we should put you into quarantine ha ha, jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

Jim:  An allergy? I never thought about that, I don’t think I’m allergic to pollen though and I’m desensitized to bee stings after being stung so many times, Hmm…

Jim:  Ow! Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

Tom:  Just checking if you’re allergic to peanuts, I guess not.

Jim:  Not funny! I could have gone into Anaphylactic Shock.

Tom:  Okay my bad, how about dust? This office is full of it.

Jim:  Yes the whole is office is dusty yet I only feel affected near our desks!

Jim:  You brought your cat into the office?!

Tom:  Yes, it’s Mr Snuffle’s birthday today, I didn’t want him to be alone on his special day!

Tom:  I guess we found the problem, your allergic to cats!
