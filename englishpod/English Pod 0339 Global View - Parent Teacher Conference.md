## Dialogue
A:  Thank you for coming tonight Mrs. Webber.  As a teacher, it’s great seeing the kid’s parents assist our parent-teacher conference night.

B:  Of course!  I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve.

A:  Well Allen is a great student. He is a hard worker and very well behaved, however he does struggle a bit with math.

B:  I guess he gets that from me, I never did well in math when I was a kid.   What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom.

A:  Well, it’s important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math. I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions. It will really help a lot.

B:  Thanks a lot! I will definitely do that.  Is there anything else?

A:  Um.. yes.  Here is a notice from our financial department, seems your child’s tution is overdue.

B:  Oh yes,  I....
