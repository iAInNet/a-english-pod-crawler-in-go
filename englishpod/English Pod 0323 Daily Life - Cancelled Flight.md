## Dialogue
A:  Good afternoon Sir, may I please see your passport and reservation? 

B:  Here you go. 

A:  I’m sorry sir, this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems. 

B:  Cancelled! So what am I supposed to do now? 

A:  We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this. If your flight is urgent, I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening, but it’s on a first come first served basis, so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight. 

B:  What’s my other option? 

A:  If you can wait until tomorrow, we will put youup in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning. 

B:  That’s fine. I’ll do that then. 

A:  Thank you for your understanding sir. I will book your flight now.
