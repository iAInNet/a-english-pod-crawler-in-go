## Dialogue
A:  Honey,  of course  I  forgive  you!    I  love  you   so  much!   I've  really  missed  you.   I   was  wrong   to get  upset   over   nothing.

B:  I'm   sorry   I haven't  called   or   anything,   but  right after   you  decided   you  wanted  a  break,   I  was  called  up  north to put out  some  major  forest fires!   I  was in the middle of nowhere,   working  day and night,   trying   to prevent  the  blaze   from  spreading!   It  was  pretty  intense.

A:  Oh,   honey,    I'm   glad     you're   okay!   But  I    have    some   exciting   news... I  think   I'm   pregnant!

B:  Really?    Wow,   that's  amazing!    This  is  great   news!   I've   always  wanted  to be  a  father!   We'll   go  to   the   doctor   first thing in the morning!

C:  We     have  your  test results  back  and,    indeed,   you   are  pregnant.   Let's  see  here...  everything seems to be in order.    Your   approximate  due date  is   October twenty-seventh two thousand and nine,    so  that  means  that  the  baby  was  conceived    on   February third, two thousand and nine.

B:  Are   you   sure?   Are  these things  accurate?

C:  Well,   yes  sir,   they   are.

A:  What's wrong?    Why   are  you   asking  these  questions?

B:  This  baby   isn't  mine!  I   was  away  the  first  week  of   February  at  a  training seminar!

A:  I... I... no,  it can't  be...
