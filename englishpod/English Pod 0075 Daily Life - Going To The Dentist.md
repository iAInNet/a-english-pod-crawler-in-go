## Dialogue
A:  Hey,   Gary,   great to see you again. Please have a seat. So tell me, what seems to be the problem?

B:  Thanks,   doc. I've got a really bad toothache! I can't eat anything, and look, my face is all swollen. I think it might be my wisdom tooth.

A:  Well, let's have a look. Open wide. Hmm... this doesn't look good.  Well, it looks like you have a cavity  and your crown is loose. We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse, and the crown probably needs to be refitted. I'm going to order some x-rays.

B:  Is it gonna hurt?

A:  No, not at all! Just lay back and relax.

A:  Ok,   spit.
