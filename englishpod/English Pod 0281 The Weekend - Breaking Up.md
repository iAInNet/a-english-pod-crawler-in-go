## Dialogue
Lydia:  Hello? 

Maggie:  Hey! Do you want to go out tonight? 

Lydia:  No, I think I’ll pass. Mark broke up with me. I feel awful. 

Maggie:  What?!? What happened? Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together! 

Lydia:  I don't know what I did wrong. He said he needed some space to figure things out... He said I didn’t do anything wrong, that I’m a great person... just not the one for him... 

Maggie:  Ugh! That’s so cliché. Mark’s not worth your time, Lydia. You deserve so much better! 

Lydia:  I know we had hit a rough patch but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend, when we both had some time off... I think he found someone else. I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a coworker... 

Maggie:  Whatever. He’s a jerk, forget about him! There are many more fish in the sea. 

Lydia:  Talk about being cliché, Maggie! But you’re right. There’s no use for me to sulk around... Let’s go out tonight!
