## Dialogue
A:  Do you two have any plans for the evening?

B:  We were thinking of  checking out  a restaurant in the neigbourhood.  Do you have any suggestions?

A:  I know this really nice Italian place.  The food is fantastic, and the décor is beautiful.  I'd recommend giving it a try.

C:  Actually, I'm  not all that crazy aboutItalian Italian food; I’m in the mood for   something a bit   lighter.

A:  In that case,  I know a great little bistro.  They make a really tasty seafood platter;   the fish is outstanding.

B:  It sounds fantastic, but I’m allergic to seafood, so...

A:  Okay, well, let me think...   Oh, I know this great little place.  It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing   sandwiches. You gotta give them a try.

C:  Ella, you took me there last time I visited, and I got food poisoning,  remember?
