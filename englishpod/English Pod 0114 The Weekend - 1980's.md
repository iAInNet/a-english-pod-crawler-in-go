## Dialogue
A:  Jim! What's up man!

B:  Charlie! Is that your ride?  It's butt ugly, dude!

A:  Don't be a airhead! This is a nineteen sixty-nine Chevy Impala! I just need to fix it up a bit. In a couple of months, this baby is gonna be wicked!

B:  Not even!  Check it out! Now that's a fresh ride!

A:  Too bad the driver is a major dweeb. Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy is loaded like his.

B:  He's coming this way, be cool.

C:  Hey guys! What do you think of my automobile? Isn't it bad to the bone?

A:  Word! The ladies are gonna be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.

C:  You really think so?

B:  For sure!

C:  Awesome!

A:  Psych! haha.. you totally fell for it.

C:  You are a real scumbag, Charlie.  When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

B:  Dude, don't have a cow!
