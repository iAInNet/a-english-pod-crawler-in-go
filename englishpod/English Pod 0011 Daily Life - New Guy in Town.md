## Dialogue
A:  Oh,   I don't know if you heard,  but someone moved into that old house down the road.

B:  Yeah,  I know.  I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in.  His name is Armand.

A:  Really?  What's he like?  You have to  fill me in.

B:  Actually,  he's a bit strange.  I don't know... I've got  a bad feeling about him.

A:  Really?  Why?

B:  Well,  yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift,  but Armand started acting really weird,  and then he practically kicked me out!  I tried to,  sort of, peek into his house,  but everything was so dark  inside that I couldn't really get a good look.  

A:  Well,  you'll never guess what I saw this morning.  A delivery truck pulled into his driveway,  and it dropped off a long,  rectangular box.  It almost looked like a coffin!

B:  You see!  Why  would he...

C:  Hello ladies...

B:  Ah,  Armand!  You scared the heck out of me!  This is my friend Doris.

C:  A pleasure  to meet  you...If you are not doing anything tonight,  I would like to have you both for dinner.  I mean...I would like to have you both over for dinner.
