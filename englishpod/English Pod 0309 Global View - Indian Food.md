## Dialogue
A:  So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to? 

B:  It’s an Indian restaurant! I know you have never had Indian food, so I thought you might want to try. 

A:  That sounds great! I am craving some type of beef dish. 

B:  Well, Indian cuisine actually doesn't serve beef. You see, cows are a sacred animal, a very important element inthe Hindu religion, so beef is not eaten. 

A:  I see, so what are we having? Chicken? 

B:  There are many amazing dishes to choose from. We can havesome chicken tikka masalawhich is an amazing curry. It’s a bit spicy, but I think you can handle it. 

A:  Sounds good! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food. 

B:  Yeah. Also, we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven. Since you don’t use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop upthe curry or rice. 

A:  What about veggies? 

B:  They have a good variety of vegetable based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas or Daal.
