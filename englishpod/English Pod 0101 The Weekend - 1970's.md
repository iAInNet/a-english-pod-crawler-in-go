## Dialogue
A:  Hey man! How's it hanging?

B:  Hey man! Everything is just groovy baby!

A:  Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?  I heard it was far out, man!

B:  I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place.

A:  Right on, right on! Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite! He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

B:  Gravy!  Jim is such a jive turkey man. He is always hitting me up for cash.  Anyway, you wanna book and go grab some grub?

A:  Yeah man, I'm starving!
