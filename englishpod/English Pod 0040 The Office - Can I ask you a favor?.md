C:  You   know   what?    I'd   love  to help   you,    but   I'm    about to    meet   an  important    client.    Do   you   wanna  try  Sean   instead?    He   sits   right over there.

A:  Sorry to interrupt you  Sean,   could   you  do me a quick favor?

D:  Actually,   I'm   working   on  a   document   that   is   due   in  a couple of  minutes.    I   really   can't   talk   to you    right now.      Sorry   about  that.

A:  Geeze!    I   just   want   to know  where  the   bathroom    is!     What's  wrong   with  you  people!
