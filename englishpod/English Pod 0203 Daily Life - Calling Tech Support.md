## Dialogue
Tech guy:  Hello, thanks for calling 123TechHelp, I’m Todd. How can I help you? 

Client:  Hello? Can you help me? My computer! Oh man...  

Todd:  It’s okay sir, calm down. What happened? 

Client:  I turned on my laptop and it broke! I mean, the monitor went black! 

Todd:  Ok, sir, it sounds like you might have a virus. 

Client:  I don’t feel sick,...let me check... Nope! No fever, I’m fine. 

Todd:  No, your computer might have a virus, I mean, it has a bad program on it. Maybe that’s why it crashed. I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans. 

Client:  Phew! ……Wait a minute,  CRASH??!! Spyware? Trojans! What? where? when?!
