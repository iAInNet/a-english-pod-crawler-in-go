## Dialogue
Older gentleman:  Oh dear Miss, you are soaked! Wow, it's really raining heavily outside.

Michelle:  Yes, it sure is. I had to run here from work! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break.

Older gentleman:  Well please, why don't you go ahead of me in line? I'm in no hurry.

Michelle:  Oh, that's so nice of you! Thank you very much.

Older gentleman:  My pleasure Miss. Actually, could you recommend what to eat here? I've never been here before.

Michelle:  Sure. Well, the avocado sandwich is delicious, and it's the healthiest thing on the menu. Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice. I usually get that. Also, the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town!

Older gentleman:  Well, thanks for the suggestions.

Michelle:  Oh, don't mention it.
