Mr. Campbell:  How are you Melissa? Are you okay?

Melissa:  I'm great thanks, Mr. Campbell.

Michelle:  Do you have any business trips planned soon Mr. Campbell?

Mr. Campbell:  Of course. I'm always travelling! I will leave for London next Monday, and then I'll fly to Boston from there. It's going to be a busy month. How about you Michelle? Any vacation plans?

Michelle:  Yes. Mike and I will travel to Beijing to see Mikes parents for Spring festival, and hopefully next year we will visit London. I hear it's a wonderful city.

Mr. Campbell:  I couldn't agree more. London is really fantastic. It's my favorite city. I'm sure you'll have a great time.
