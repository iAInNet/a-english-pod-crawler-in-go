## Dialogue
A:  We've   been over this a thousand times.  The data   is irrefutable! Look, we've done extensive research, built studies, and read the literature, and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory!

B:  Horowitz, I beg to differ.   Even in your most recent study, the investigative approach was flawed! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was   not systematic, and  there is   a large margin of error.   To draw    a definitive conclusion based on that data  would be misleading

A:  That is preposterous!

B:  You are trying to single-handedly    solve   one of the world's greatest mysteries, and yet you are oblivious  to the fact that you are wrong!

A:  I am not wrong! The chicken   came first!

B:  No! The  egg   came first!
