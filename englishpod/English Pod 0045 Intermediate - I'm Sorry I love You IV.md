## Dialogue
A:  ... so, I said, "let's take a break ." And since that night, I've   been waiting for him to call, but I still haven't heard from him.  You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

B:  Come on, don't be so dramatic!  I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

A:  You think so?  Oh, no! How can he do this to me?  I'm sure he's cheating on me! Why else wouldn't he call?

B:  But, you two are on a break.    Theoretically he can do whatever he likes.

A:  He's the love of my life! I've really messed this up.

B:  Come on, hon. Pull yourself together. It's going to be alright.

A:  But I... I still love him! And it's all my fault! I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being. I mean, he is a firefighter, it's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner. I've totally messed this up!

B:  You know what, Veronica, I think you should make the first step. I'm sure he'll forgive you...

A:  No, this is not gonna happen! I... I've ruined everything....

B:  Hey... do you hear something?   Guess what? It's your lovely firefighter!

C:  When I had you, I treated you bad and wrong dear. And since, since you went away, don't you know I sit around   with my head hanging down and I wonder who's loving you.
