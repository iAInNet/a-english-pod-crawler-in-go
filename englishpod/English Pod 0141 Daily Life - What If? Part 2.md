## Dialogue
A:  This is the good life! We have it good don't you think?

B:  Yeah of course! Although, don't you ever wonder what "could have been"?

A:  What do you mean?

B:  Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.

A:  For example?

B:  Like for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.

A:  I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.

B:  You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!

A:  Well, I have no regrets!

B:  I'll drink to that!
