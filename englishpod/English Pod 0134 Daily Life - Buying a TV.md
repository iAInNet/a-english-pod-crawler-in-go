## Dialogue
A:  Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.

B:  Honey I told you already. I can't appreciate the graphics level and detail of the games on my Playstation 3 on our old TV.

C:  Good afternoon folks! How can I be of service today?

B:  I'm looking to upgrade to a newer, bigger television set.

C:  You've come to the right place! What size are you looking for?

A:  Just a normal sized TV for our living room.

C:  I see.  Well this set here is on sale. It's a forty six inch HDTV screen and has all the works. Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA and S - Video ports. It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop! This is without a doubt the complete home theater experience!

B:  This is exactly what I need! Can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?

A:  Honey, I think it's a bit too big.  I don't even think it will fit in our living room.

C:  Not to worry, we will deliver and install it in your home.  It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture!

B:  This is great! How much will this set me back?

C:  Lucky for you, this is the last one we have in stock so it's half off!

B:  I'll take it!
