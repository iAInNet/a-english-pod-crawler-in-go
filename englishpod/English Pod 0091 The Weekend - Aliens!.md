## Dialogue
A:  Oh  honey, this is so romantic! I have never seen so many stars before! It's beautiful!

B:  See that constellation there? That's Orion! And the very bright star? Well, it's not a star since it doesn't blink. That's actually Venus.

A:  What's that big flashy one?

B:  I don't know... I think it's a UFO!

C:  Greetings earthlings. I come from afar, from a distant galaxy known only to a few.

A:  Why are you here? Where did you come from?

C:  We have been observing you for the last three thousand years. We have seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the Taj Mahal or masterpieces such as the Haffner symphony. Unfortunately, your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.   Your ambition and desire for more will be your downfall, and we are here to save your planet from you.

B:  You think you have us figured out?  What gives you the right to come and judge us? Who are you to play God with our fate?

C:  Silence human! It is that belligerent attitude that has caused years of pain and anguish among yourselves! Now you will pay the price!
