## Dialogue
A:  Woo hoo! This just might be the start of the rest of my life! 

B:  What happened? 

A:  I'm in the market for a job! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for. I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write. I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally. And you know I can be charming in interviews. Goodbye my penniless days! Hello salary and a career! 

B:  Ben, we're fifteen. What kind of job are you looking for? 

A:  Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant. You know, starting at a simple lowly job, just like all the greats before they made it big in the world. 

B:  Uh-huh. 

A:  But I'm just in it for the money, right? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies? Besides, I love the smell of gasoline, don't you?
