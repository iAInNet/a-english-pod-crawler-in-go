Ralph:  ah, who’s Jimmy?

Ralph:  You, umm… ah…. yeah, you’ll take off your hat and scratch your head! 

Sammy:  Right. When I take my hat off and scratch my head, you do what? 

Ralph:  I get in the box. 

Frankie:  Right, you get in the box. I’ll make sure it’s all sealed and then, posing as a delivery guy, I'll drop off a ‘special package’ for the manager. Now, according to Jimmy, the bank manager is leaving early on Tuesday 'cause it’s his wedding anniversary. He and the wife are having a romantic rendezvous in the country, so any packages delivered will be left unopened in his office until he gets back late on Wednesday…. 

Sammy:  ……Which gives us access to his office for at least Come hours…. Ralph, this is where you come in…. where are you? 

Ralph:  I’m standing right next to you Sammy, Sorry Sam, I’m in the box. Right there… in that box.

Ralph:  I stay in the box until the bank has closed, . I get out of the box. 

Sammy:  …. then? What next, Ralph? Oh for Pete’s sake! This is never going to work.

Ralph:  Hey, give me a chance here, fellas! I, um, I crack the safe . then, thenI take the money…. then I… ummmmm, I get back in the box. 

Frankie:  'Atta boy Ralph! In the morning I come back to the bank, say there’s been a mix-up with the delivery I made and take the ‘special package’ back here. 

Sammy:  Alright, let’s get some sleep… it’s a big day tomorrow fellas! 

Frankie:  A perfect plan, Sammy! It went off without a hitch! 

Sammy:  Let’s open this up and get Ralph out here so we can start counting the money! 

Ralph:  Phew! I sure am glad to see you guys! I was sure getting lonely with no one to talk.
