## Dialogue
A:  Hi! We are the Christianson's! We are here to see the apartment.

B:  Oh, hi! Sure, come on in! Well, as you can see, the place has just been renovated. The previous tenants left a huge mess here, so the landlord has redone everything.

A:  It looks great. It's so bright and airy! What great light! I really like these hardwood floors. What's the square footage of this place?

B:  Well, it's about 120 square meters, or 1300 square feet, more or less. Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen    appliances.  There's a new dishwasher, and a professional-grade gas range. Really, at this price,  this place is an amazing deal!

A:  I love it! But what are the payment terms?

B:  First and last month rent as deposit and rent is due on the 1st of every month. Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal!

A:  Yes,  it is! Too good to be true...

B:  The living room and dinning room  are quite   spacious as you can see,  and down this hall, here's the  master bedroom. It has a huge walk-in closet and an en suit bathroom.   We can't go in there yet as the police... I mean the clean up crew hasn't finished.

A:  What do you mean? What's in here?
