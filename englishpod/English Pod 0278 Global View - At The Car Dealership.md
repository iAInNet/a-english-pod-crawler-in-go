## Dialogue
A:  Hi there! I am looking for a new car. I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.  

B:  I see. You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it’s the end of the year, 

A:  Perfect! I like this one. 

B:  That is the Ford Focus. A very light but powerful vehicle. It comes with dual side airbags, power steering and power windows, tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission. 

A:  Sounds like a good car! How many miles to the gallon?  

B:  It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway. 

A:  That is really convenient. Especially now that fuel prices are so high! What’s under the hood? 

B:  A very powerful  2.5-liter turbocharged engine, Trust me, this car is fast! 

A:  Now for the most difficult question. What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle? 

B:  Very affordable sir. You can take it out of this lot today with 0% down payment and no interest for the first year! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.  

A:  Great! Let’s do it!
