## Dialogue
A:  Mike! Hey, how are you,   man! Long time no see!

B:  Hey,   Pat! Yeah, I haven't seen you in ages! How are you?

A:  I'm doing great!   It's  funny running into you like this. Just last week I ran into Matt as well.

B:  Yeah? How's he doing?

A:  He's doing well.  We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.

B:  Oh yeah?

A:  Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing, talking about work   and family, when all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and  he   completely  lost it!   He  started  freaking out,   and  screaming...

B:  Ha ha, really?

A:  Yeah, and the funniest thing was, that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl. You had to be there! Everyone was staring and laughing... it was hilarious!
