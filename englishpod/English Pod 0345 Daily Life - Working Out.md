## Dialogue
A:  Do you want to go catch a movie tonight? 

B:  I can’t, I have to go tothe gym. 

A:  Come on! You can go tomorrow, just skip it today. It’s not as if you are gonna get in trouble! 

B:  Actually I will! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don’t go. I like it, because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy. 

A:  That’s cool, does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out? 

B:  Yeah. He makes a work put plan depending onthe areas I want to work on, orthe muscles I want to build. Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights. Then for my quads, calves and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats. 

A:  Sounds like you are really getting in shape!
