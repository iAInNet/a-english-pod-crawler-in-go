## Dialogue
A:  Can you help me set up my voicemail message?  I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say.

B:  Sure!  You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called, and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.

A:  Ok, so can I say, “ This is Abby’s voicemail.  I will call you later, so leave me your name and number”.

B:  That’s more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

A:  Ok, so how about this, “ This is Abby and I am really happy you called!  I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number.  Talk to you soon!”.

B:  A little too friendly Abby.  Just say this, “  Hi, you have reached Abby.  I am unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks”.

A:  That’s perfect!  Can you say that again and record it for me?
