## Dialogue
A:  Help me organize these coins. 

B:  That’s a lot of money! What did you do? Break the piggy bank? 

A:  Yeah, I’m gonna go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles. 

B:  Ok, I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies. 

A:  Great, then we can add everything up  and take it to the bank. 

B:  I found some coins that are not from here. 

A:  Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London. I have a couple of different pence, but in all it won't add up to one pound. 

B:  Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you? 

A:  Hopefully!
