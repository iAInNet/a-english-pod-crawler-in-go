## Dialogue
A:  So what are you doing for Thanksgiving? 

B:  Not much really. It’s more of an American tradition, so back home we don’t really celebrate it. In fact, I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated! 

A:  Well you know, it’s a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything! 

B:  Yeah but, how did this holiday come to be? 

A:  Well, the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James. Once inthe New World, they befriended an native named Squanto, who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn. 

B:  Interesting! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are! 

A:  Come to my house for Thanksgiving! We are having turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes with gravy, and lots of stuffing! 

B:  Count me in!
