## Dialogue
A:  Has the game started yet?

B:  Yeah, about 5 minutes ago.

A:  Who’s winning?

B:  The Bulls, of course!

A:  What! That wasn’t a foul! C'mon,  ref!

B:  Don't  worry, Shaq always screws up   free throws.

A:  You were right!  He didn't make the shot!

B:  That was a great shot!  A three pointer, yeah!

A:  Did you see that? He traveled and the ref didn't call it!

B:  This ref needs glasses.  Hey ref, open your eyes! I can't  believe    he  didn't see that!

A:  Okay...    end of the first quarter...   Alright,  I'm gonna make a beer run.
