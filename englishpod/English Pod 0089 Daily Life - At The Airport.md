## Dialogue
A:  Next please! Hello sir, may I see your passport please?

B:  Yes, here you go.

A:  Will you be checking any bags.

B:  Yes, I'd like to check three pieces.

A:  I'm sorry, sir. Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage, at twenty kilograms each, plus one piece of carry-on luggage. I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

B:  What? Why! I am taking an intercontinental flight! I'm flying sixteen thousand kms! How am I supposed to only take two, twenty kilo bags? That's absurd!

A:  I am sorry,   sir, there's nothing I can do.  You cannot board the flight with that large bag either. Carry-on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat. That bag is clearly too big.

B:  Now I see.  You charge next to nothing for an international ticket, but when it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg! So tell me,   miss, how much  will I have to pay for all of this.

A:  Let's see... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars.

B:  That's more than my round-trip ticket!
