## Dialogue
A:  I've never heard of AmLion College.  Could you... 

B:  Of course sir, let me give you a brief overview. AmLion College is located in the center of New York city.  The school covers a wide range of academic subjects;  and eighty percent of the courses are transferable to other state universities. And, last year  AmLion College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.  

A:  Interesting, and what about the tuition fees, then? 

B:  You'll be looking at somewhere around fifteen thousand US dollars per semester. 

A:  Okay, well. 

B:  And, did I mention our on-campus housing?  Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as three thousand dollars per month! 

A:  Sounds good. Well. I'll just grab one of your flyers. 

B:  Sir, you got the wrong flyer. Sir, sir!
