## Dialogue
A:  Hi I would like to return this TV.

B:  Sure, do you have the receipt?

A:  Yeah here you go.  Actually I also want to return this keyboard.

B:  Ok, may I ask what is the reason for returning these products?

A::  The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.

B:  I see, and what about the keyboard?

A:  I spilled some coffee on it and now it won’t work.

B:  I am sorry sir, but we can only exchange or refund defective products, we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

A:  Fine!  I don’t know why they make these things so delicate anyways.
