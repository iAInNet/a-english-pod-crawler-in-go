## Dialogue
A:  Look, Jimmy’s report came today.

B:  Let’s have a look.  What is this?  Where are all the grades?

A:  He’s in the third grade Sam! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school, he receives a mark from one to three.  A one means his achievement or work is excellent.  Here in Science for example he got a two, which means its satisfactory.

B:  What about here in physical education?

A:  He got a three here which means it’s unsatisfactory. We should work on that with him.

B:  So confusing!  In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F!
