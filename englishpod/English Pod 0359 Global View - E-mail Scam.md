## Dialogue
A:  I got an urgent email from Tom! He says he is in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel. 

B:  What? That sounds really dodgy tome. 

A:  No way, Tom is an honest person, he wouldn’t lie tome. 

B:  No I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out. I mean think about it, why would he email you instead of calling you. 

A:  Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money? 

B:  For sure! There are so many con artists out there, you never really know.
