## Dialogue
A:  Wow, that terrible movie is finally over. Next time I'm picking the film, because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick.

B:  Well you should have picked, in the end you always complain about everything.

A:  Not everything, just this film. Even the title is ridiculous; and it's so long, those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life, so much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.

B:  I'm thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative.

A:  I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.

B:  You see, that's what I'm talking about, I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore

A:  Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.

B:  Well he's more of a man than you are; at least he appreciates love stories.

A:  Love? More like one-night-stands.

B:  Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours; they're no saints.

A:  My friends? Fat? What about those whales you call friends?

B:  You're unbearable; you can walk home, I'm leaving.
