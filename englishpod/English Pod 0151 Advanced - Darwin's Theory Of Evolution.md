## Dialogue
A:  It’s been a long time since I last saw you. Where have you been? 

B:  The exams and plans I have to turn in in are driving me crazy, I don’t even have time to sleep. 

A:  It’s the same for me. I'm up to my neck in work, but at least finals are coming soon and we’ll have a vacation. Where are you going now? 

B:  I’m going to Anthropology class and now with the year anniversary of Darwin, it’s the only thing we study. Frankly, I'm sick and tired and tired of hearing about this guy. 

A:  What? Why? How can you not like Darwin? I mean the man changed the entire perception of how things came to and his theory is backed by pretty solid evidence! 

B:  I don’t like him. His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes. It lacks the solid evidence of which you speak of. 

A:  That statement puts you at odds with half of the academy. Not to mention your professors! Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of species and the mechanism of natural selection constitutes a grand step toward a coherent understanding of the world and evolutionist ideas. 

B:  I'm not minimizing his grand contributions, it’s just that his theory reminds of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg. 

A:  What are you talking about? 

B:  The question is, which was first? The chicken or the egg? I feel the same regarding his theory. How does the first cell of life come to be? 

A:  Interesting. I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class. In the meantime, how about we settle this... with a due!
