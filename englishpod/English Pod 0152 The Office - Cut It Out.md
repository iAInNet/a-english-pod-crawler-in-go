## Dialogue
Ed:  Hey, Mary, can you cut that out? 

Mary:  Cut what out I'm not doing anything. 

Ed:  The tapping of your pen on your desk. It’s driving me crazy. 

Mary:  Fine! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup! 

Ed:  I don’t slurp my coffee. And plus, how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time? 

Mary:  You 've got to be kidding me! You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze? 

Ed:  Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, and it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while But, it's probably not a good idea to keep it up I’m willing to forgive and forget and if you are. 

Mary:  Fine. Let’s call a truce. I’ll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down 

Ed:  Yeah, I'll try to do the same. So, I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night?
