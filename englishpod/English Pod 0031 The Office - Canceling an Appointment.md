## Dialogue
A:  Hello, Samantha speaking.

B:  Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling.

A:  Oh, hi Angela, what's up?

B:  I'm just calling about our meeting today. I wonder, is it possible to reschedule   our   appointment in the afternoon? I have a bit of an emergency   that I need to take care of.

A:  Let me see, it shouldn't  be too much of a problem...

B:  I'm  really sorry, I hope it  doesn't  inconvenience you too much, it's  just this thing came up,   and ...

A:  Angela, you know what, I   can't  make it to our meeting, either. Why don't  we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

B:  Sounds great. See you tomorrow.

C:  Angela...  Angela, look    up! See that lady over there who is trying on a  red leather jacket? Isn't that Samantha?

B:  What? No wonder she told me she couldn't  make it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me...
