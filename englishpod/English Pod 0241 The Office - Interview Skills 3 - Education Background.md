## Dialogue
Mr. Parsons:  Now, if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English? 

Rebecca:  Yes, that's right. After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK. My major was English, and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004. 

Mr. Parsons:  Yes, I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction. 

Rebecca:  Yes that's right. I've always enjoyed studying. My friends say I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed academically. 

Mr. Parsons:  Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca. So how about extra-curricular activities at University

Rebecca:  Well I've always been keen on on writing, so I became the editor for the University student magazine, which I really loved. Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter, to help the homeless in York. 

Mr. Parsons:  What did that involve? 

Rebecca:  Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . 

Mr. Parsons:  I'm sure. Okay, now let's move on to your work experience, shall we? 

Rebecca:  Yes, okay.
