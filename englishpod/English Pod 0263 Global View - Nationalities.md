## Dialogue
A:  Hey! How was your first day of class? I'm in level two and I'm loving my class this semester! It's great being in a class of international students! 

B:  Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester. 

A:  That's both fortunate and unfortunate. It's the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, we also have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians! 

B:  That's quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian. 

A:  Well, I think you're pretty lucky actually. You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture. 

B:  I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes. 

A:  Don't! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice. 

B:  I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese. 

A:  Well, there is that, yes.
