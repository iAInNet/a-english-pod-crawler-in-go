## Dialogue
Lawyer:  Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, My client, Robert Malone,  has been accused of a crime he did not commit. The prosecution has accused my client of being a pickpocket! I know we have heard the testimony of many people here today, …. people who claim the defendant, my client, stole their wallets. I feel sorry for these victims, I really do……… but my client is innocent! 

Lawyer:  Let’s look at the facts…  one: These 'so-called' witnesses did not actually see the defendant steal anything………. two: When the police stopped him, he did not have any of the stolen wallets. There is no evidence. 

Lawyer:  Therefore,  Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to think carefully before giving your verdict. My client is innocent! 

Judge:  Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? 

Jury member:  Yes, your honor. our verdict is……not guilty! 

Robert:  Thank you so much! You were great! Thank you for all your hard work! 

Lawyer:  You’re welcome Robert! I knew you were innocent so my job was easy. Take care of yourself, okay?
