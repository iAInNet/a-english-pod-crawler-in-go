## Dialogue
Mr Parsons:  Okay Rebecca, well I think you'vegiven me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses. 

Rebecca:  Okay, well it's always more difficult to describe them isn't it? 

Mr Parsons:  Definitely, but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be? 

Rebecca:  Well as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work or career. I suppose I'm quite a restless character. My father always taught me to be a high achiever so. 

Mr Parsons:  So would you say if things don't go your way at work it could easily get you down?

Rebecca:  Well, in a way yes. But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work I always give 110% I would never shirk my responsibilities. I suppose sometimes Iexpect too much too soon. 

Mr Parsons:  Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself it's true. Okay well lets move on to talk about the job position here shall we? 

Rebecca:  Yes please.
