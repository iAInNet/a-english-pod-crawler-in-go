## Dialogue
A:  Nick!  How's it going?

B:  Oh,  hey...

A:  What  are you doing in this neighbourhood?  Do you live around here?

B:  Actually,  my   office is right around the corner.

A:  It was great to meet you last week at the conference.  I really enjoyed our conversation  about  foreign investment.

B:  Yeah, yeah,  it  was really interesting.  You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry,   but here's my card.  We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

A:  Sure,  you still have my contact details,  right ?

B:  You know what,  this is really embarrassing,  but your name has just  slipped my mind.   Can you remind me?

A:  Sure,  my name is Ana Ferris.  Don't worry about it; it  happens to me all the time.  I'm terrible with names too.
