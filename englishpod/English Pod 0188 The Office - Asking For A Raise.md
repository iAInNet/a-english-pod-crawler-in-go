## Dialogue
A:  Excuse me sir, may I talk to you? 

B:  Bill! Sure, come on in. What can I do for you? 

A:  Well sir, as you know, I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years. 

B:  Yes. 

A:  I won't beat around the bush. Sir, I would like a raise. I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first. 

B:  A raise? Son, I would love to give you a raise, but this is just not the right time. 

A:  I understand your position,  and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales, but you must also take into consideration my hard work, pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade. 

B:  Taking into account these factors, and considering I don't want to start a brain drain, I'm willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time. How does that sound? 

A:  Great! It's a deal! Thank you, sir! 

B:  Before you go, just out of curiosity, what companies were after you? 

A:  Oh, the electric company, gas company and water company!
