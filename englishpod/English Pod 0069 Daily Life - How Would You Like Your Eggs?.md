## Dialogue
A:  Wow, you're      up     early  today!   What's  for  breakfast?

B:  Well,       I   felt like   baking, so   I   made   some     muffins.

A:  Smells  good!   I'll   make  some   coffee. Do   you   want   me   to make   you   some eggs?

B:  Sure, I’ll     take    mine,  sunny side up.

A:  Eww,   I don't know how   you can eat      your eggs like that! Ever since I was small, I've  had eggs and soldiers.

B:  You know, my dad had   scrambled eggs eggs   every morning   for twenty years. It drove my mom crazy!

A:  You know what really drives me crazy?   When I ask for  soft boiled eggs,       and     they   overcook   them,   so they come out   hard boiled! How can you dip your   toast into a hard boiled egg?

B:  You're so picky sometimes.

A:  Here you go, honey, fried eggs.

B:  Dammit!  I  asked for   sunny side up!    How many times do  I have to tell you.
