## Dialogue
A:  Really, gentlemen,   you can't take me to jail!   Don't  you know who I am?  Kris Kringle,  you  know,    Papa Noel,   Pere Noel,     Babbo Natale,  sheng dan lao ren!

B:  Yeah, Yeah, we've  heard that one before, haven't  we Joe?

C:  Yeah, last week we booked this guy   who claimed to be the tooth fairy!     Can you believe that?

A:  It's Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to deliver!  Where is your Christmas spirit?   What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find  any   gifts in their stockings?

B:  Sorry buddy, you  were parked   in  a   no-parking zone,    you were speeding,  and you have no ID!

C:  Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh has been impounded  and  those reindeer  were taken to the city zoo.

A:  What! This is unbelievable! What's this world coming  to? Christmas is ruined!

C:  What's that up ahead?  It looks like...  elves!!  Elves!!  Whoa, they're  shooting  candy canes!  Mayday,   Mayday,  we are under heavy attack!   We need backup!
