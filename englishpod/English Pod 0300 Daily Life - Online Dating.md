## Dialogue
A:  Do you want to hang out tomorrow? 

B:  Oh, I can’t. I have a date! 

A:  Really? Wow with who? 

B:  This girl I’ve been chatting with forthe past couple of months. She’s really cool and she’s driving over here this weekend. 

A:  Wait a minute, you mean you met her online? 

B:  Yeah! I signed up for a website called match. and it is great! You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets. Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat. 

A:  That is kind of weird! What if she is a psycho or something like that? 

B:  It’s the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends! I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy. 

A:  I guess it does seem logical. I’ll have to check it out!
