## Dialogue
A:  Excuse me? Is this where I register?  I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

B:  Yes, of course.  I need your student ID please.

A:  Here you are.

B:  Okay, Susan. It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year. Is this information correct?

A:  Yes. I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

B:  Sure. That's not a problem.  Do you have the list of courses you want to take this semester?

A:  Yeah. Here's my list. I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though.

B:  Yeah, that's perfect.  What about the subjects for your minor?

A:  Oh yeah! Almost forgot! I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology and neuroanatomy.

B:  Wow, you are going to be busy this semester!  Okay, here you go.  You are registered now; you'll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.
