## Dialogue
Waitress:  Hi, welcome to Happy Buddah!  Can I get you anything to drink? 

Manny:  A Coke for me, please. 

Andrea:  I’ll have a Sprite. 

Waitress:  Okay, I’ll go get that for you. Are there any questions with the menu? 

Andrea:  Do you use MSG? 

Waitress:  No ma’am, we are MSG-free. 

Andrea:  Oh man, I haven’t had Chinese food in so long!  I want everything! This place has the BEST sesame chicken.  

Manny:  Yeah, I’ve been craving Chinese for such a long time.  I used to get take-out all the time. It’s definitely been a while.  Let’s start off with some crab rangoon. 

Andrea:  Ooh yeah, that sounds good. I think I’m going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice,  a spring roll, and egg drop soup. 

Manny:  It’s so tempting to order everything on the menu, it all looks so appetizing! I think I’ll get General Tso’s chicken,  hot and sour soup,  fried wontons,  and white rice.  

Andrea:  Aren’t you supposed to be on a diet?  You should at least get brown rice.

Manny:  I don’t think so!  I hate brown rice, and I’m so sick of eating healthy all the time. I’ve been eating so much salad I swear I’ve forgotten what meat tastes like! There’s no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie-laden Chinese food. I might even get an order of broccoli beef! 

Andrea:  Gosh, I’m so hungry! Let’s call the waitress over!
