## Dialogue
A:  Let’s got out tomorrow night.  We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.

B:  I don’t think that’s a good idea.  I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.

A:  Maybe you just need a few pick up lines,you know, break the ice. 

B:  Pick up lines don’t work!

A:  Come on!  You can just walk up to a girl and say: “If you were a booger I'd pick you first.”

B:  What?  Come on!  That’s just lame!  No girl would fall for that!

A:  Fine, then you can say: “So there you are! I've been looking all over for YOU, the woman of my dreams!”

B:  That’s a good one!  I think that’s pretty funny.

A:  Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink.

B:  Ok, how does this sound: “I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.”

A:  Nice! Let’s go!
