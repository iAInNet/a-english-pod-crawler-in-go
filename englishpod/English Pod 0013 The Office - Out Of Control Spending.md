## Dialogue
A:  OK, so now the last point on our agenda.  Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

B:  Great.  Well,    the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

A:  Let's see... These numbers are off the charts!  What's going on here!

B:  Well, um, sir,  the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.  Look at these bills for example. Just this month we've paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges!

A:  OK,  thank you. I'll look into it.

B:  The list goes on and on.  Here, this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments!

A:  Thank you; that will be all. I'll   take care of it.

B:  Look at  this one sir, eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called "Wild Things"?!

A:  OK,  I get it!!  Thank you for your very thorough analysis!
