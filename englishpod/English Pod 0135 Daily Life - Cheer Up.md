## Dialogue
A:  Ok... I'll talk to you later. Bye

B:  Carrie, are you ok? You seem a bit down.

A:  I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.  He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It's so hard to talk to him at times.

B:  Maybe it's just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.

A:  Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off.

B:  Men are like that you know.  They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

A:  I guess you are right.  What do you think I should do?  He wasn't always this grouchy you know...

B:  Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!

A:  You are something else you know that?
