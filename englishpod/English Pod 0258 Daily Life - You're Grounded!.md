## Dialogue
A:  Do you know what time it is? 

B:  Um. Ten? 

A:  Get in this door young man. It's midnight, you are two hours past curfew. 

B:  I know, but it wasn't my fault! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten, but she wouldn't leave the party! 

A:  I don't care! You are grounded for life mister! 

B:  Mom! That is so unfair! 

A:  You know the rules and you broke them. No allowance and no TV for a week. I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down! 

B:  What! For being a couple of hours late? You have to be kidding! 

A:  I don't want to hear it! Now go to your room!
