## Dialogue
Officer Brown:  Ok Sally, we have an artist here to help us. We’ll ask you questions about the bank robber you saw and Paul will draw a picture. Are you ready? 

Sally:  Yes, hmmm. Well, he had brown hair…… long hair…… and he had some facial hair…… was brown, too. 

Officer Brown:  Good! Ok, the facial hair, was it a beard or a mustache? 

Sally:  Both! His mustache was very short and thin, …. on the top of his lip. 

Paul:  un-uh hmmm…, like this? 

Sally:  Yes, that’s the mustache! But the beard isn’t right, mean, it didn’t cover his whole face…. think it was just on his chin. 

Officer Brown:  A goatee? Was it like Paul’s? 

Sally:  Ah yes, that’s it, he had a goatee.........

Paul:  Okay, what about sideburns? Did he have sideburns? 

Sally:  Um, they were long and thick, yours! 

Paul:  Alright, was this the man you saw? 

Sally:  Yes, that’s him! Hmmmmm, he looks a lot like you. 

Officer Brown:  Hmmm, why yes he does. Paul, where were you on Friday afternoon? 

Paul:  What? That’s ridiculous! It wasn’t me! I didn't do anything.
