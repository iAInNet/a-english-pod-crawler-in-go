## Dialogue
A:  Hey, you're early! Where's everyone?

B:  Well... I told them not to come. I made a reservation just for the two of us. I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves.

A:  Oh... why?

B:  Jennifer, there's something I wanna ask you.

A:  Sure. What is it?

B:  Hmm... okay, here's the thing. I've always seen you as more than just a friend, and I can't take it any more. I know you better than anyone, I know the pros and cons of your personality, I even know what side of the bed is yours! I think we would be great together, don't you?

A:  Are you serious? We've been friends for years!  We can't just change that overnight!

B:  I know! I never had the guts to tell you...  until today.  So, what do you say? Are you willing to give me a shot?

A:  I... I...
