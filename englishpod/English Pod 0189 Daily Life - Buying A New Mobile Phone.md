## Dialogue
A:  Hello sir, may I help you? 

B:  Yeah, I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet. 

A:  I see. Well, you have come to the right place. We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers. 

B:  Sounds good. I don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range. 

A:  We have this new HTC smart phone. It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications. It also has a built-in camera, mp3 player and touch screen. It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are. 

B:  What about Wi-fi? 

A:  Of course! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home. 

B:  One last thing. Is it waterproof?
