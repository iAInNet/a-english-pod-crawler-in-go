## Dialogue
A:  This is ridiculous!  I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone  else! How could you do this! You know what? I'm out of here!

B:  Wait! Doctor how is this possible?  I haven't   cheated on my boyfriend!

C:  I have something to confess... I'm sorry Veronica, I lied.

B:  Wait...  what?  What do do you mean?

C:  I lied.  You aren't even pregnant; there's no bun in the oven. I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself.  Veronica I love you!

B:  What are you talking about!!! Who are you?

C:  It's me! Daniel, don't you remember me? From high school.   I sat behind you every day in class!  I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad!

B:  You are insane! We never even spoke!  Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

C:  Because Veronica... It's not fair!  I love you; I have since the first day we met!  Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything! I went to med school and became a doctor for you! You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor!  You will be mine now... one way or another...

A:  I heard everything, you lying bastard!  Get your hands off her!
