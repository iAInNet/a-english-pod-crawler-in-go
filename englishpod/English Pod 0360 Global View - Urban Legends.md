## Dialogue
A:  Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world? 

B:  What do you mean? 

A:  I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed! Then they are sold onthe  black market. 

B:  Don’t tell me you actually believe all that? Don’t beso gullible, they are just urban legends. They are just stories people make up to scare you. 

A:  Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards! Can you believe that? 

B:  You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song? Don’t beso naive! 

A:  Well maybe you are right, but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown  in order to get bigger chickens faster! 

B:  Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true don’t you think?
