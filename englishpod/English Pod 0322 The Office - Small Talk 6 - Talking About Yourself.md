## Dialogue
Michelle:  Excuse me, is this seat taken?

Stranger:  No, please feel free.

Michelle:  Thanks a lot.

Stranger:  Do you work in Shanghai?

Michelle:  Yes I do. How about you?

Stranger:  No, I'm a tourist. This place is amazing! It's much bigger than I imagined, and much more exciting! There's so much to see here.

Michelle:  You can say that again! It's much more modern than people imagine. Where are you from?

Stranger:  Um, well let's see.....I'm from Kansas originally. A much quieter and more peaceful place than here, that's for sure!

Michelle:  Uh huh....

Stranger:  But I'm living in Paris right now.

Michelle:  Oh Paris! Wonderful, I'd love to visit some time!
