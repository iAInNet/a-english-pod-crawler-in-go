## Dialogue
Sarah:  Tom! How are you? We missed you at the party last night. Are you ok? 

Tom:  I don’t know. I didn't really feel like going out. I guess I'm feeling a little homesick. 

Sarah:  Come on We've been through this already! Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it. 

Tom:  I was. It’s just that the holidays are coming up and I won’t be able to home because I can’t afford the airfare. I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom’s cooking and being around my family. 

Sarah:  Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I’d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it. 

Tom:  I see what you mean, but I 'm still bummed out. 

Sarah:  Ok how does this sound: let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there! 

Tom:  You know, I could really go for that. You don’t mind being my wingman for tonight?

Sarah:  Not at all! It be fun! It will be like a boys night out... well kinda... 

Tom:  Great! I must warn you though, whatever happens, don't let me go on a drinking binge. Trust me, it's not a pretty picture!
