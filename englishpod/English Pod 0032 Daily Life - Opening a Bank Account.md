## Dialogue
A:  Next, please.  May I help you, sir?

B:  Hello, yes, I'd  like to open   a bank account.

A:  Certainly, I can can help you with that.  What type of account would you like to open?  A chequing or a savings account?

B:  What What features do they offer?

A:  Well, if you just take a look here, see, with our chequing account,  you can have unlimited daily transactions     for a small monthly fee, and our savings account   has a higher interest rate,    but you must carry a minimum balance of $  10,000 dollars.

B:  I see, well, I think I'm    more interested in a chequing account; I like to have   easy access to my money.

A:  Alright, then, with this chequing account you'll be issued   a  debit card and a cheque book.  Will you require overdraft  protection?  There is an extra fee for that.

B:  No, that won't be  necessary.

A:  In that case, I'll get you  to fill out  this paperwork; I'll need your  social insurance number, and two pieces of government ID. If you could just  sign here, and here, and here; we'll be all set.  Would you like to make   a    deposit today?

B:  Yes, I'd like to deposit    one billion    dollars.
