## Dialogue
Shop assistant:  Good afternoon, sir, is there anything I can help you with today? 

Mark:  umm... yeah!I’m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend. Our fifth anniversary’s next Friday. 

Shop assistant:  Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her. Is there anything particular that you have in mind? 

Mark:  No, not really... I'm  completely at a loss. 

Shop assistant:  Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings, or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant. What is her favorite gemstone? 

Mark:  That purple one. I’m sorry...I've never bought jewelery for anyone and I’m kind of nervous. 

Shop assistant:  Don’t worry, we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.  That stone is an amethyst. We have a range of beautiful amethyst  pieces. Take a look at this bracelet. It’s 18K rose-gold, studded with amethyst and blue topaz. It’s a great statement piece. 

Mark:  Oh...wow. That’s really pretty. Jess would love that. But... I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace? 

Shop assistant:  We have this beautiful platinum pendant, or you could also get her a locket. You could also get her a timepiece---it's both glamorous yet functional. If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her. 

Mark:  Jess? Well, she’s very smart, and has a great sense of humor.  She’s very feminine...

Shop assistant:  Perhaps you could give her a ring? 

Mark:  Well...actually...I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me...I've just been so nervous.

Shop assistant:  Well sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose! 

Mark:  Okay, I’ve decided. I’m going to pop the question! 

Shop assistant:  Fabulous! We should look at engagement rings then! Now that’s a whole other section.
