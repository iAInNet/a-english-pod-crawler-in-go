## Dialogue
A:  Help!  Are you a doctor?    My poor little Frankie has stopped breathing!  Oh my gosh, Help me!  I tried to perform CPR, but I just don’t know if I could get any air into his lungs!  Oh, Frankie!

B:  Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor!  Someone page Dr. Howser.  Get the patient to hold still, I can’t get a pulse! Okay, he’s on the monitor.  His BP is falling! He's flatlining!

A:  NOOOOOO! Frankie! Nurse! Do something!

B:  Someone get her out of here! Get me the defibrillator.  Okay, clear! Again!  Clear!  Come on! dammit!   I'm not letting you go! Clear! I've   got a pulse!

C:  Okay, what’s happening?

B:  The patient is in acute respiratory failure, I think we’re going to have to intubate!

C:  Alright!  Tube’s in!  Bag him! Someone give him 10 cc's of adrenaline! Let’s go, people move, move!

A:  Doctor, oh, thank god!  How is he?

B:  We managed to stabilize Frankie, but he’s not out of the woods  yet; he’s still in critical condition. We’re moving him to intensive care, but…

A:  Doctor, just do whatever it takes. I just want my little Frankie to be okay.  I couldn’t imagine life without my little hamster!
