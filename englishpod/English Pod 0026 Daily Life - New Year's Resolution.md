## Dialogue
A:  So, did I  tell  you   about  my   New Year's resolution?   I've  decided   to go  on  a   diet.

B:  And   you're  going  to   completely transform   your  eating habits,   right?

A:  Exactly!   I'm   going   to cut out  all  that  junk  I  eat;  no more  chips,   no more    soda,    no more   fried  food.

B:  I've  heard   this  one  before.

A:  But this  time   I'm   going  to stick to  it.   I  really  mean it!   Trust  me,    Carol,   I'm    going   to be  a  new  man   in one year's time!

B:  Well,    I  guess  we'll just  have  to wait and see.

A:  Thanks,   honey,    that  was  a   great  meal.   I'm   stuffed.   Do   we  have  any  chips  left?
