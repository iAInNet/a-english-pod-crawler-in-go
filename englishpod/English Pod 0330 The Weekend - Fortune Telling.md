## Dialogue
A:  Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium.  It says that she is really gifted and so popular now, that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months!

B:  You don’t really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo do you?

A:  Well I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true!

B:  Of course it does!  They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house.  I think most of the times they are just scam artists.

A:  Well historically it is a practice that many cultures share.  Reading the tarot cards, in the east they would even read tea leaves! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar, and then read your ashes.

B:  All superstitious nonsense!  I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say, just for kicks.

A:  Great!  I’ll make an appointment!
