## Dialogue
A:  Mr.      McKenna,    do   you   have a second?    I  need  to talk  to  you about  something.

B:  Sure,    Liv,   what can I do for you?

A:  Well,   I   was  just  wondering... you   see,    I  know I've  used up  all  my   vacation days   this  year,     but   my   sister  is getting  married,  and   the   wedding is  overseas,     and,    well...

B:  You   wanna   take some time off,    is  that  right?

A:  Well,     sir,    I  was  just  hoping  that  I  might  be able  to take   some  unpaid leave   this   year.

B:  What   dates  are  you  planning on   taking off?    I'll  need at least   two   months   notice,    so  that  I  can  plan  for  your  absence.

A:  I  was thinking of  taking off   from  September first  until   the   thirtieth. Would  you  be okay with that?

B:  Well,    I   guess  so.
