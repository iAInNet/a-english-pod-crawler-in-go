## Dialogue
A:  Car trouble center. How may I help you? 

B:  My car won't start! Stupid old car! 

A:  Hold on, before you kick your car let's go through some possible problems. 

B:  Fine. 

A:  Ok, first of all, can you turn the key in the ignition? 

B:  Yeah! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor. 

A:  Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank? 

B:  Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.  The engine won't start. Should I maybe press the accelerator? 

A:  No. If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start. 

B:  So what do you think it is? 

A:  I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline? 

B:  Umm. yeah! Right! I got the car started! Thanks for your help! I told you to fill the tank!
