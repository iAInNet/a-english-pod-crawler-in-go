## Dialogue
A:  And so, that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year. Thank you very much for your time.

B:  Hey, that was quite the presentation!  Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.  I’ve gotta say, Alex, you really wowed me today.

A:  Aw, come on; it was nothing.  I’m just doing my job.

B:  No, I think you deserve some recognition here; I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

A:  Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.  She’s a real wiz on PowerPoint.

B:  And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.  I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions.

A:  Yeah, well, that was some good advice.  You made some really good points.
