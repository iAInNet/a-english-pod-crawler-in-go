## Dialogue
A:  This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O'Connell  reporting  live from Washington,   D. C. where a  protest    has broken out.  Thousands of  angry citizens are protesting  against the  proposed bailout of  the auto manufacturing industry!   Sir,  sir,  Sar

B:  Yeah,  yeah,  we  are  here  because  we  feel  this  is  an  injustice!   The  financial irresponsibility of  big business has to stop!    We're  here   to show  the   government that  we  don't   like  the  way  that  they're  spending    our  tax dolla

A:  Sir,  but  what exactly   is making  everyone so  angry?

B:  It's  an  absolute  outrage,   Sarah,  the  US government  wants to give twenty-five billion  dollars of  taxpayers' money to  the  auto industry.  These are companies that  have been mismanaged and  are  now nearly bankrupt.

A:  I see.   But,  many supporters of  the bailout argue  that  it  could  help save  the  jobs of  millions of  hardworking Americans.

B:  That may be  true,  and I for one don't  want  to see  anyone  lose their  job,  but  how can these  CEOs ask  for  a  bailout when  they're  making  millions of  dollars?    And  then they have the nerve  to fly  to  Washington   in  private  jets!  This

A:  Good point.   This  is  Sarah O'Connell  reporting  live  from  Washington D. C.,  back to  you,   Tom.
