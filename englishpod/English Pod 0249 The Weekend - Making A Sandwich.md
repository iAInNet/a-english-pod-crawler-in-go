## Dialogue
A:  Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let's get started ! 

A:  Let's start with the basics :bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing -choose the bread according to the following criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color. 

A:  Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients ! Of course, each person's palate is different, but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.  I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich. 

A:  Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and  light. The best choices here are evident- cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs- you can't go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil. 

A:  Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.  We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt! 

A:  That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next time!
