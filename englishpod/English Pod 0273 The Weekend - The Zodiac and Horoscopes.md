## Dialogue
Angela:  Hey Lydia, what are you reading? 

Lydia:  I’m looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, and that I will have a passionate summer fling! 

Angela:  What are you talking about? Let me see that… What are horoscopes? 

Lydia:  It’s a prediction of your month, based on your zodiac sign .  You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I’m an Aries. When were you born? 

Angela:  January 5th. 

Lydia:  Let’s see… you're a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we’ll both have interesting summers! 

Angela:  That’s bogus. I don’t feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense. 

Lydia:  No it’s not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize. 

Angela:  Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they’re so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me? 

Lydia:  A Capricorn  is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. * laughs * That sounds just like you!
