## Dialogue
A:  Ok, that's fine. Bye. 

B:  What happened? 

A:  That's it, my lease is up. I have to move. 

B:  What? Why? Can't you renew it? 

A:  The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot 

B:  Well, I can help you pack. We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP. 

A:  I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something. You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here. I'm gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while. 

B:  Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out. 

A:  Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks? 

B:  hehe.. sure
