## Dialogue
A:  Welcome to Galanet.  How can I help you?

B:  Hi.  I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

A:  Of course. We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from. The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month. This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps.

B:  I have no idea what kbps means.  I just want to be able to get online, play games and chat with my friends. Oh, and watch movies online as well.

A:  Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.  I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes.  That way you can play games online without any lag.  This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free!

B:  Do I have to pay an installation fee?

A:  Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.  You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there! And we'll throw in this pen drive!

B:  Awesome!
