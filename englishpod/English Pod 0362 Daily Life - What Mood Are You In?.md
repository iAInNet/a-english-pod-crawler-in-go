## Dialogue
A:  Are you ok?   You seem a bit anxious. 

B:  Yeah I’m OK, I have been having a lot of mood swings  lately. I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones. 

A:  So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next? 

B:  Yeah, it’s weird. For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely, even though there was really no reason to feel that way. 

A:  Well, maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave and hopeful! 

B:  I hope you are right.
