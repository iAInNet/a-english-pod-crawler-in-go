Melanie:  Sure Tracy, let me just get my laptop. all set. 

Tracy:  Okay, so……. toWhom It May Concern, I am writing. 

Melanie:  Um, Tracy? I think that’s a little too formal. I know you want to be polite but you’ve already made contact with them, so in English you can be more relaxed inthe opening…. 

Tracy:  Okay, more relaxed. Got it…. Hey Sally, what’s up? It’s Tracy here, just. 

Melanie:  Okay Tracy, now it’s too relaxed! You’ve still got to show some respect. How about starting with “Dear Ms. Cooper, I’m writing to confirm…? 

Tracy:  Great, okay. “Dear Miss Cooper, I’m writing to confirm the final quotation forthe full page back cover color advertisement you requested forthe spring issue of Voila magazine. 

Melanie:  That’s great…. 

Tracy:  “ The final costing, including advert design and production, comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RMB. We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad. Thanks for…” 

Melanie:  Woo, okay back up a second Tracy. That’s too direct. Can I suggest you say, " please note thatfinal payment is due two working weeks before publication? You don’t want to offend her. 

Tracy:  Oops okay. You are right. Then I can just end with “All the best, Tracy” 

Melanie:  Hmmmm, maybe, but I’d play it safeand just finish with “Yours Sincerely”. That’s more professional. 

Tracy:  Oh, Melanie you are a life saver, thank you!
