## Dialogue
A:  Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow?

B:  Yep. The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns. 

A:  We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs.

B:  Yeah, good idea. We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill. I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.

A:  Great! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers.

B:  This is gonna be a great barbecue!
