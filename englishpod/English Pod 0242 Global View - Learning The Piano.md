## Dialogue
Charles:  Hi Cody, how did practicing go this week? 

Cody:  Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn't get a chance to memorize the second page, but I think I mastered the tricky section. 

Charles:  Great! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first. Good, good. This week, work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the  last part with the sixteenth note . Now let's take a look at this tricky section. 

Cody:  Charles? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here? 

Charles:  It might work. I'll have to hear it . Show me what you've done. Not bad , not bad . 

Cody:  It  was horrible! I played play it  much better at home! 

Charles:  It's just nerves. Just play  the right hand for now. One two three four five six, ta ti tri-ple-ti. Good, good. Don't forget the accidentals! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but now it's a G-natural. Now add the bass clef. You're going too fast. Remember the tempo for this piece is andante. 

Cody:  Is that better? 

Charles:  Yes, much better. Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal. What was that? 

Cody:  Sorry! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make. 

Charles:  That's ok, keep going, you're moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics! Keep your elbows lifted. Remember to stroke the keys, don't pound. That's better! Remember that as a pianist or any other musician, your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship.
