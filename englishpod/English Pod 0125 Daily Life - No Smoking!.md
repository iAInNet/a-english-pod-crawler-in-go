## Dialogue
A:  It smells like an ashtray in here!

B:  Hi honey! What's wrong? Why do you have that look on your face?

A:  What's wrong?  I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking.

B:  No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different.  You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight!

A:  Look, there are other ways to quit.  You can try the nicotine patch, or nicotine chewing gum.  We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place.  It's not like you can just light up like before.

B:  I know, I know.  I am trying but, I don't have the willpower to just quit.  I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch! Please understand?

A:  Fine! I want a divorce!
