## Dialogue
A:  How about this floor lamp? 

B:  Fine just get it! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours! I'm so tired! 

A:  We still need to find an armoire and a dresser. 

B:  Fine! I am going to go home and drop off  this nightstand, coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things. 

A:  Great! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I'll also get a bean bag and a dining set. 

B:  While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner?  I really want one so I can watch TV.
