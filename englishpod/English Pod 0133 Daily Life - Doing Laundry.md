## Dialogue
A:  Ok, let's go through this one more time. I don't want anymore ruined or dyed blouses!

B:  I know, I know.  OK, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine.

A:  Right. You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing.  For example for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle.  Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.

B:  So complicated! Ok, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out?

A:  Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.

B:  Cool. Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and its all set right?

A:  No! Since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes.

B:  You know what? I'll just have everything dry cleaned.
