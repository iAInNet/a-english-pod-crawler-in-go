## Dialogue
Melissa:  Hey Michelle, jump in quick. It's pouring out there!

Michelle:  Oh hi Melissa. Are you going to the conference too? I was planning to pick up Mr. Campbell.

Melissa:  Yes, he told me. We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference.

Michelle:  Oh I see, okay. So I heard you got married. Congratulations!

Melissa:  Ah thank you! I'm very excited. We were going to get married next year, but then we decided to get married on holiday instead. It was wonderful.

Michelle:  That sounds so romantic! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans. We just don't have the money!

Melissa:  I know what you mean. I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive, don't you?

Michelle:  I sure do. In my opinion it's actually becoming more expensive than back home.

Melissa:  Definitely. Oh there's Mr. Campbell. Driver can you stop here please?
