## Dialogue
A:  Oh great! This stupid computer froze again!  That’s the third time today!  Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC?  It’s acting up again.  It must have a virus or something.

B:  Just give me a second;  I’ll be right up.

B:  I ran a virus scan on your computer,  and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files!

A:  But I’m quite careful when I’m browsing the internet,  I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

B:  Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly; yours wasn't up to date,  that's probably what was causing your problems.

A:  Ok.  Anything  else?

B:  Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer!

A:  Um yeah… Sorry about that.
