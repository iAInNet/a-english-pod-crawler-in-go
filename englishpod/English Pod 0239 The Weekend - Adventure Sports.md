## Dialogue
A:  Welcome to Adventure Tours . How may I help you? 

B:  I want to book a tour with adventure sports . 

A:  Excellent! Our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . Let me show you some options. This is our most popular choice, our river guides will take you on a whitewater rafting trip followed by a ride in a hot air balloon ! 

B:  I don't really think I'm ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon. What else do you have? 

A:  Well, in that case, we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors. It's the closest you can get to flying. 

B:  What? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite? No thank you! Next! 

A:  Mmm. ok. Well, why don't you tell me a little bit more about what you would like? We have everything from mountain biking, to rock climbing to street luge. 

B:  I'm thinking something exciting but. safer. 

A:  I have the perfect option, this package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there's a dog sledding journey! 

B:  That's more like it !
