## Dialogue
A:  What are you doing awake?

B:  I can't sleep...

A:  But it's almost midnight!

B:  Exactly. I'm too excited for Christmas morning. Also, I thought I heard Santa.

A:  Really? How do you know it was Santa?

B:  Well I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings, so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies. I even left out some milk. I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies, so I came downstairs!

A:  Hmm... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree, spying on him!

B:  Really?

A:  Really! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed. That way, we can let Santa do his job. Then when you wake up, it will be Christmas already!

B:  O-K...

A:  Hey, honey! Is that you? Don't eat all the cookies - I want some, too!
