## Dialogue
A:  Honey, we are all out of wine and cheese. Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things? 

B:  Can't it wait? I'm watching the game right now! 

A:  Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things. 

B:  Fine! What do you need? 

A:  Ok, pick up some cured meats to go with the wine. Maybe a pound of polish sausages, ham, liverwurst, salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale. I think I saw a promotion for pastrami. Also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives. 

B:  Whoa wait a minute! Isn't that a bit too much? I mean, how much is all of this going to cost! 

A:  Never mind that. Get some dips as well. Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki. If they have bean dip get that as well. Last but not least, get some pickles. 

B:  Is that all, your majesty? 

A:  Very funny! Get a move on! People will be here any minute.
