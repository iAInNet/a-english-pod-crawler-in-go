## Dialogue
A:  Hey, Jordan, is that you? Long time no see! 

B:  Oh, hey, no kidding! I haven’t seen you since orientation three months ago! So how’ve you been? Settling into college life OK? 

A:  Yeah, I think so! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I’m living atthe frat house now. 

B:  Oh, so you’re a frat boy now, huh? 

A:  Yeah, yeah, I know, it’s totally cliché, but really, I think it’s been a good decision. I’ve got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys. What about you? What have you been up to? 

B:  Not much. I’m still living at home and commuting to school. I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about. It just wasn’t as interesting as I’d hoped. The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count. 

A:  That sounds smart…but kind of boring. 

B:  Yeah, it is, a little bit. I joined the Great Outdoors Club, though, which has been a lot of fun. We’ve gone on two camping trips already, and I’ve made some good friends. 

A:  That’s cool. Hey, so have you decided on your major yet? 

B:  Definitely pre-med. What about you? 

A:  I still have no clue…but we don’t have to declare a major ‘til our sophomore year, so I’ve got time! Oops, I’m late for class. Gotta run! 

B:  OK, take care! Hey, nice running into you!

A:  Yeah, you too!
