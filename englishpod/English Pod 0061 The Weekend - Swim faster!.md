## Dialogue
A:  This  is  such  a  beautiful    day!   Great  for  sailing!

B:  It sure is!    The   water   looks   so  nice!    Anchor  the   boat  for a little while.      I'm   going to take a dip.

A:  Why   are    you   doggy-paddling?    I  taught   you   how   to swim!    Do   your   breast stroke!

B:  I   get   too   tired!   I'll   just   backstroke,   it's  easier!

A:  Try  kicking  your   legs  more.    That's   good.    Don't   go out  too    far!

B:  It's  Jump in!

A:  Kathy!    Get back here!    I  see  a   shark!

B:  Ahhhh!!!!   Help me!  Help!    Bring   the   boat  closer!    The   shark   is coming   straight towards  me!

A:  It's   right under  you!     Kathy!!!!!
