## Dialogue
Ash:  I can’t seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already!

Mindy:  Well, have you thought of getting an MBA? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.

Ash:  An MBA hey… well my degree wasn’t in business, the business schools won’t be interested in me.

Mindy:  Nonsense! The business schools measure your ability   through a test called GMAT.

Ash:  GMAT? What does that stand for and what will the test contain?

Mindy:  Graduate Management Admission Test, it contains three parts; Analytical Writing Assessment, the Quantitative section, and the Verbal section.  Not only does the test mark you on the number of questions answered but also on the difficulty.

Ash:  Okay this sounds a little tough, how am I supposed to practice for this?

Mindy:  Up to you, you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions, you can also use free or private computer software. Going to church might help as well!

Ash:  No matter what I do I’m going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat!

Mindy:  Umm…That’s the spirit!
