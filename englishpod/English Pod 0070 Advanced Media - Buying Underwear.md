## Dialogue
A:  This sucks;  I  hate   buying   lingerie.   Okay,    just  find  something   and   get out of here.   Alright,   these  are  fine.   Oh, no,    don't   come over here, don't     come over here.

B:  You   look  a little  lost,  can  I   help  you?

A:  Um, I'm just having a look around.   It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow.  I’m trying to find her something.

B:  Well, you can't give her granny panties.  Have you thought about   getting her some sleepwear?  We've got these lovely, silky nighties. Or, how about  a nice panty-and and-bra set.  Look, here's a nice satin push-up bra, and you can choose a few  different styles of undies to go with it.

A:  Sure that's fine.

A:  This is so awkward...what ones do I pick?  What size is she?

B:  Well, do you want a thong, some bikini briefs,  maybe this nice pair of lacy  boy shorts?

A:  Just pick something and get the hell out of here.

A:  Um,  I’ll go with these two.

A:  This is mortifying; I just want to get this over with.    She better thank me for this...

:  Here you are,  sir. I'm sure she'll enjoy them.

B:  Finally!

A:  I'm sorry, sir. I'm going to have to take a look inside your bag.
