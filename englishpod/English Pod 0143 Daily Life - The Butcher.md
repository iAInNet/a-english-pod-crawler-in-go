## Dialogue
Butcher:  Hi. What can I get for you?

Gina:  I’d like a half a pound of ground beef, please.

Butcher:  Good choice! Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean.

Gina:  Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts?

Butcher:  No, no no no chicken breasts at the moment, but we have some nice chicken thighs.

Gina:  No, that won't do.  I'll take this smoked ham you have here.

Butcher:  Okay, is there anything else?

Gina:  Do you have any other cold cuts?  Is this salami and bologna you have here?

Butcher:  Yes! It's very fine meat! Made it myself...

Gina:  Sounds good.  Okay, that's it.

Butcher:  Wait! We have T-bone, rib eye, and sirloin steaks. They are very fresh! Just came from the slaughter house...

Gina:  Mmm... No that's okay, really. I think that's all for today.

Butcher:  Okay.  That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents.
