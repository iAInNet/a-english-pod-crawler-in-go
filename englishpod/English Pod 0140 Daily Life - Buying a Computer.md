## Dialogue
Customer:  So can you fix it?

Sales Clerk:  I'm sorry sir.  This computer is not broken or damaged.  It's simply just too old!  That's why your programs and applications are running slow. There really isn't much I can do.

Customer:  What do you mean?  I bought this computer just three years ago!

Sales Clerk:  Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster!

Customer:  Ok, I know where this is going.  How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

Sales Clerk:  Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.  It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte. Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard and desk speakers.

Customer:  I have no idea what you are talking about.  I just want to know if it's good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time!

Sales Clerk:  This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze! If it does, we'll give you your money back!
