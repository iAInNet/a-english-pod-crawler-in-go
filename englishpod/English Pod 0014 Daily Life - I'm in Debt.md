## Dialogue
A:  Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Corleone.

B:  Right this way, sir.

C:  Charlie! What can I do for you?

B:  Mr. Corlone, I’m really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

C:  Anything for you, Charlie! Your father was like a brother to me.

B:  Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard; I lost my job and I’m in a lot of debt.

C:  I see……

B:  Yeah, you know, I’ve got credit card   bills, car payments, I’ve got to pay my mortgage; and on top of all that,  I have to pay my son’s college tuition.

C:  So you’re asking for a loan.

B:  Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

C:  What? At a time like this? I’m broke too, you know! You’re not the only one who has been hit by the recession! I lost half my money in the stock market   crash! Go on! Get outta here!
