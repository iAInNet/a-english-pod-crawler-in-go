## Dialogue
A:  Hey  Carl,   can  you    make   a  copy  of   this  contract  for  me please?   When  you   have  it   ready,    send   it  out  ASAP   to   our  subbranch.

B:  Sure!   Um... I  think   I   broke   this  thing.    Maxine,    can   you   help me out  here?     I'm  not  really   a  tech  guy.

C:  Yeah,   sure.   I  think   it's   just  out of  toner.   You can  go   use  the  other one   upstairs.   On your way  up,      can  you   fax   this   while  I    try   and   fix  this  thing?

B:  Sure!   Dammit!   Everything   in  this  office  seems  to be    breaking down!    Never mind.   I'll  send  this  stupid  fax  later.   Oh   great!    Is  someone    playing  a   practical joke   on  me?  This   is  ridiculous!

D:  The  elevator   has   some sort  of  malfunction.    Just   take the stairs  dude.   What   floor  are   you   going  to?

B:  I  have  to go   up  fifteen    floors!   Never mind.     Made it!      There  is  the  copier!
