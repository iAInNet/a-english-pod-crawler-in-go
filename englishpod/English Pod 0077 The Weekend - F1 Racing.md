## Dialogue
A:  Welcome back racing fans! My name is Rick Fields and, as always,   I am joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

B:  We're in the last stretch  of this very exciting race, and Kimi Räikkönen  is leading the pack with only four laps to go! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton    tries to pass Räikkönen! It's a close one    and, oh no! Hamilton  hits the wall!

A:  He came  in too fast, jammed on the breaks and spun out. We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track.

B:  The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops! Räikkönen  is still in the lead with only two laps to go!

A:  Smoke is coming out of his car! He seems to be having engine  trouble! He makes his way into the pit, and Fernando Alonso  takes the lead!

B:  How unlucky for Räikkönen,  and this race is over ladies and gentlemen,  Alonso takes the checkered flag!
