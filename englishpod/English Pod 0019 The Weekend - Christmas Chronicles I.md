## Dialogue
A:  I hate working on Christmas Eve!  Whoa!  Get a load of  this guy!  Come in  central,  I think we've got ourselves a situation here.

B:  License and registration  please.   Have you been drinking  tonight,  sir?

A:  I had one or two glasses of eggnog,  but  nothing else.

B:  Step out  of the  vehicle,  please.  Sir,  what do you have in the  back?

A:  Just a few Christmas  gifts,  'tis the season,  after all!

B:  Don't take  that tone  with me.  Do you  have an invoice  for these items?

A:  Umm...no...I make these in my workshop  in the  North Pole!

B:  You are under arrest,  sir.   You have the right to remain  silent.  You better not pout,  you better not cry.   Anything  you say  can and will be used against you.   You have the right to an attorney;  if  you cannot afford one,  the state  will appoint

A:  You  can't  take me  to  jail!  What about  my sleigh?   It's Christmas Eve!  I have presents to deliver!  Rudolph!   Prancer!   Dancer!   Get help!
