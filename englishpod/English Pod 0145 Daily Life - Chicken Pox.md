## Dialogue
A:  What's wrong with you? Why are you scratching so much?

B:  I feel itchy! I can't stand it anymore! I think I may be coming down with something.  I feel lightheaded and weak.

A:  Let me have a look. Whoa! Get away from me!

B:  What's wrong?

A:  I think you have chicken pox! You are contagious! Get away! Don't breathe on me!

B:  Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy! We can't be sure until I see a doctor.

A:  Well in the meantime you are a biohazard! I didn't get it when I was a kid and I've heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult!

B:  Are you serious? You always blow things out of proportion. In any case, I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath.

A:  Ewww!
