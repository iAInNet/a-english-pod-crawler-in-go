## Dialogue
A:  I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married!

B:  Yeah,  well,  it's about time.  He's been living with his parents for forty years!

A:  Don't be mean.  Look,   here come the bridesmaids!  Their dresses look beautiful!

B:  Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

A:  That's the flower girl and the ring bearer. I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew.  Oh, they look so cute!

B:  I just hope the priest makes it quick.  I'm starving.  I hope the food's good at the reception.

A:  That’s all you ever think about, food!  Oh, I think the bride's coming now!  She looks gorgeous. Wait, what's she doing? Where's she going?

B:  Oh, great! Does this mean that the reception is canceled?
