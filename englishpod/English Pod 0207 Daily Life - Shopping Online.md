## Dialogue
A:  What are you doing? 

B:  I'm just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay. 

A:  You are shopping for a pillow online? That's absurd! 

B:  Why? I don't have  to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I'm looking for. This way, I just search for it online quick and easy. 

A:  I see, but how do you pay for it? How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller? 

B:  Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy. 

A:  Wow, that sounds pretty safe. So how do you pay? Do you need a credit card? 

B:  You can use a credit card or your debit card. They also let you use the PayPal system  which is really safe and fast. I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything. 

A:  Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online? 

B:  You can find anything! Are you sure you want to start shopping online though? Once you step into this world, there is no turning back! 

A:  Let's do it!
