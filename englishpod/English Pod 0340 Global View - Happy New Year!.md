## Dialogue
A::  It’s almost midnight!  We are about to start a brand new year!

B:  I know it’s so exciting! A new year is always like a clean slate.

A::  fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

A:  Do you have a New Year’s resolution?

B:  I was thinking about it, but I’m never able to keep my New Year’s resolution.  Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice.

A:  Yeah I know what you mean.  That’s why this year I am keeping things more simple.  Maybe like getting together with friends I haven’t seen in a long time, or doing some volunteering work.

B:  That seems reasonable.  We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

A:  Sure, as long as you don’t try to kiss me at midnight!

B:  Well, we can’t break tradition!  It’s bad luck!
