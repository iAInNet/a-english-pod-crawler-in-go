## Dialogue
A:  Hello,  Arthur. What seems to be the problem?

B:  Hey doc.   Well, I think I   might   need glasses.   I'm  getting headaches, and I really struggle to see   things that are far away.   But I   have always had 20/20 vision.

A:  Sounds like you may be  far-sighted.   OK,   then,     cover your left   eye   and read  the chart  in front of  you.

B:  Mmm… X, E, R, 3, a question mark,   and I can't quite make out  the other   symbol   but   I  think  it's    the peace sign.

A:  Wow,  Arthur! You're as blind as a bat!

B:  Yeah,   I know, my vision is really blurry at times.

A:  Ok, then,  head on over to the other room  and pick out  some frames while I   fill out your prescription.

B:  Thanks,  doc!

A:  Arthur, that's the bathroom.
