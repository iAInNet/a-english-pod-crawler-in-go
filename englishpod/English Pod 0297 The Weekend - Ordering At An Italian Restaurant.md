## Dialogue
A:  Good evening ladies. My name is Josh and I'll be your server tonight. May I take your order? 

B:  Do you have any recommendations? 

A:  Well, I personally like the chicken penne with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine is also very nice. 

B:  Hmm. I'd like to have the grilled chicken, but can I have spaghetti instead of penne? 

A:  Of course, mam. And for you? 

C:  I... ah..I'll have the horse tripe.
