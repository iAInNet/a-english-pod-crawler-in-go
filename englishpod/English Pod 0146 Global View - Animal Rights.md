## Dialogue
A:  You should have seen the T.V. show that was on last night, the topic it covered was really interesting; animal rights.

B:  Do you really believe in that? If they are going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.

A:  Yes, but we can’t deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.

B:  I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights. If so much attention weren’t devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.

A:  You can’t compare apples and oranges; I believe that both topics are important and that we can’t ignore them, the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.

B:  Well, you are right on that point. This is the reason that I don’t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.

B:  At least you’re doing your part. My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.

A:  As long as you don’t treat it better than your wife, it’s fine.
