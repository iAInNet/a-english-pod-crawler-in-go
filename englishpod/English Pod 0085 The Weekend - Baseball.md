## Dialogue
A:  Hello baseball fans, and welcome back to today's  game! My name is Rick Fields and of course, I am here, once again, with the man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland.

B:  It's a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions.

A:  Well, the national anthem has just been sung, and the umpire has started the game. It's time to play ball!

B:  Roger Vargas is up at bat. The pitcher winds up and   strike one!

A:  A very nice curve ball by the pitcher. The catcher gives him the sign, he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive!

B:  The players are scrambling to get the ball. Vargas gets to first base and he's still going! The outfielder throws it to second! Vargas slides! He's safe!

A:  Great play!

B:  We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okami! There's the pitch, he  hits it! It's going, going, that ball is gone!

A:  Home run by Okami! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium!
