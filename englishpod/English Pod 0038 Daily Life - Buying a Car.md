## Dialogue
A:  Hi  there,   can I help you folks?

B:  I'm  just browsing; seeing what's  on  the  lot.   My daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know how it is.

C:  Dad! I'm sixteen already and I'm, like,   the only one at school who doesn't have  a car!

A:  She is right, you know.  Kids these days  all have cars. Let me show you something we just got in:  a 1996 sedan. Excellent gas mileage, it has dual airbags and anti lock brakes;   a perfect vehicle for a young driver.

C:  Dad, I love it!  It's  awesome! Can we get this one please?

B:  I see...    What can you tell me about this one?

A:  Oh, that's   just  an old World War Two   tank  that  we use for TV commercials.  Now about this sedan...

B:  Whoa, whoa wait a minute. Tell me more about this tank.

A:  Well,  Sir, if you are looking for  quality and safety then look no further!  Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short range missile attacks.

B:  Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

A:  It does not.

B:  Well, I  don't  know.   Let   me   sleep on it.

A:  Did I mention the tank is a tank?

B:  I'll take it!

C:  Dad!
