## Dialogue
A:  Thanks for   coming in  today,    did  you  have  any   trouble  finding   us?     Please   take a seat.

B:  Thank you.

A:  So,    let's  get started;    tell  me  a bit  about     your  educational background.

B:  Sure!    Well,   I   graduated   with honors      from  Chesterton University   with  a  major  in  Business Administration,   with  a    specialization   in   Information Management,    and  I   minored   in   psychology.   I   chose   this     course of study      for   two  reasons:    I   wanted    to gain   some   practical,   marketable  skills,    which  the   information management  track   provided,   and   I   also  feel  that  interpersonal skills  are  essential  for   professional success,   hence  the  minor in psychology.

A:  Interesting.    And,    your   postgraduate    studies?

B:  Well,    I  am  really   passionate   about  consumer behavior,    so   I   pursued  a   master's     in  that   area.    I   also   strive  to keep   my   professional skills  current,    so   I   continuously  attend  seminars  and   conferences    related   management  and   customer service.

A:  Very   good.    Now,   tell  me   a little bit  about  your   work experience.     I   see   here that   you  previously   worked   at   Oracle.

B:  Yeah,   I   worked  as   their   customer support manager,   which   brought  me   a   breadth of    experience  in   both   client care,    and   process management.    I   supervised  and   coordinated   the  customer support team   as well as  implemented  new    strategies  to achieve  better   customer  satisfaction.

A:  Interesting...

B:  Yes,   in   this   position  I   was able   to make  some   pretty   significant   contributions  to   the   overall   success  of  the   company.   With   the   different   initiatives  that   we  implemented,   we   lowered  our  churn rate  to  about  five percent,    which   had  a   direct  impact  on  revenue.
