## Dialogue
A:  Hey honey!  Where were you?

B:  I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air.

A:  How was it?  Were there a lot of kids?

B:  It wasn’t too crowded, but we had a great time!  We got on the see-saw together, the went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym, but I didn’t fit.

A:  Sounds like fun!  When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox.

B:  Yeah, but today he was really hyper.  He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour.  I’m exhausted!

A:  You should go to the park more often since you don’t go to the gym anymore!
