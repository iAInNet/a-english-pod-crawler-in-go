## Dialogue
A:  I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven’t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need! 

B:  What are you getting? 

A:  Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender. I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker. 

B:  Don’t forget to also get a new mixer.  I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it. 

A:  Yeah I know. I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one. I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies. 

B:  I’m actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove, oven, dishwasher and trash compacter. 

A:  That’s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing!
