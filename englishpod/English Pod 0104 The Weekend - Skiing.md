## Dialogue
A:  Welcome ski lovers of all ages! My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

B:  Thank you, Rick! What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado where the sun is shinning, and we've got twelve inches of fresh powder.  It doesn't get much better than this.

A:  That's right, Bob, but today we have a special treat for our viewers.  We're joined  here by Ian Roussy, the four-time giant slalom champion.  And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing! So, let's hit the slopes!

C:  Well, first off, let's get those boots on.  You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly. That's right; now snap them into your bindings.  And you're also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eyes.  It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes.  We don't want you hitting any of those moguls!

A:  Bob, since you're a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it is a good idea to have a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

C:  Easy there, Rick!  Well, let's head on over to the chairlift, and test your skills! All right, we're up here on the bunny hill, so, Bob, why don't you do a few snow-plow turns. Gnarly run, Rick! Nice carving! You've got some mad skills!  That was sick!

A:  You wanna see gnarley?  Well, see that bump over there, I'm going to catch some major air.

C:  Butt plant!

B:  Ha ha ha!  He lost his skis!  Yard sale!!!

A:  Ahem, well.  Thanks for joining us here today, I think that about does it.  Bob, Ian, time for some après-ski?

C:  No way, man!  We're off to grab some freshies!!!
