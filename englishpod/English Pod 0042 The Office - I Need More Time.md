## Dialogue
A:  So,    Casey,    how  are  things  going   with  the  photos for  the  press kit?

B:  Yeah,    I've   been meaning  to talk  to  you   about   that.    I   might  need  to ask  for  an  extension  on  that  deadline.

A:  You've   had   over   a   month   to get    this  finalized!     Why   are things   delayed?

B:  Well,    the thing is,    we  ran into a lot  of  problems...

A:  I'm  not   looking  for   excuses  here.     I   just   want   to get  this  finished  on time!

B:  I  know,   and  I   apologize   for   the  delay.    But   some  things  were  just    beyond my control.        I   had  trouble  booking  the  the  photographer,   and   then  Michael  was  sick  for three  weeks,   so I   couldn't  include  him   in  the   photos,   and  the  design team   lost  all  the  files,  so  I  had  to redo  the  pictures.

A:  I'm   not  going to put this off  any longer,   Casey!   I  want  those  photos  ASAP!
