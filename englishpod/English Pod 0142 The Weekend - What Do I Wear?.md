## Dialogue
A:  Honey come on! We are going to be late! Honestly, you take longer getting ready than I do!

B:  I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt! Can you come here for a sec? I need your help.

A:  What is it? Why are all these clothes on the bed?

B:  I don't know what to wear! Ok, give me your opinion. Do you like the way this looks? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals. I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I'll wear these as well.

A:  Are you joking? What am I going to do with you? We are going to a dinner party not the beach!  Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants.  It's chilly outside so you can wear this coat.

B:  Thanks honey! You have such great fashion sense. Now, what am I going to do with my hair?
