## Dialogue
A:  Hey there, you look a little lost.  Are you new here?

B:  Yeah how'd you know?

A:  You can always spot the newbies.  I can give you a few pointers if you want.  Were you trying to use this machine here?

B:  Yeah! I just started my training today and I'm not really sure where to begin.

A:  It's ok, I know how it is.  This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps.  Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

B:  Well, I don't want to be ripped like you! I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

A:  In that case you want to work with less weight.  You can start off by working  ten to fifteen reps in four sets.  Five kilo weights should be enough.  Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle.

B:  Got it! Wow is that the weight you are lifting?  My goodness that's a lot of weight!

A:  It's not that much. Just watch... I'm ok...
