## Dialogue
A:  Hey man... I really like your pad. Those lava lamps are far out! Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

B:  It's no problem, brother!  I wanted a pad where people could come, listen to music and just hang loose, you dig what I'm saying?

A:  I dig it man! We could throw a bash here and make it a really happening scene!

B:  Yeah man, that would be groovy!  Hey, I gotta split for a while, are you OK here by yourself?

A:  Don't worry about me brother... You go take care of business.
