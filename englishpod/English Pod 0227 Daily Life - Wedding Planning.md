## Dialogue
A:  Trina, will you marry me? 

B:  Yes! Yes! And yes! Jared of course I'll marry you! 

A:  Oh Babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you! I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the laughter. I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.

B:  Oh Jared! I can't wait for our wedding! I hope you don't mind, but I've already chosen a date! Six months from now in the summer! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I've had plenty of time to start planning! 

A:  She what? 

B:  Oh don't worry sweetie, I didn't know when you were going to propose. It was still a nice surprise! As I was saying, I've got it all planned out. There's almost nothing left to do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending. 

A:  four hundred? 

B:  No need to sweat it My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be low-budget anyway. So roughly four hundred people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue. I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents' church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo. Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer? 

A:  Ah... 

B:  And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we'll get the Youth Group to serve us. I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night. though they might have to tone it down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. what's their name again? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise- themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine. And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake! 

A:  Wow. 

B:  See? It's going to be wonderful! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.

A:  If I survive the next six months.
