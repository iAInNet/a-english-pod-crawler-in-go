C:  Howdy man. What seems to be the problem? Is this man bothering you?

A:  Officer, officer, there is, like,   a witch creature back there! We tied her up but she broke free,   and  she was about to have us for dinner!

C:  Okay, calm down, calm down. Lemme see your eyes please. Have you been drinking tonight, son?
