## Dialogue
A:  Hi Isabel! You wanted  to see me?

B:  Yes Anthony, come on in.  Have a seat.

A:  Is everything okay? You seem a bit preoccupied.

B:  Well,  Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation. The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

A:  Okay...

B:  I don't want to beat around the bush so I'm just gonna come out with it.    We are going to have to let you go.

A:  What? Why? I mean...  just like that?  I'm fired?

B:  I'm sorry  but,  to be honest,  you are a terrible employee!

A:  What! I resent that!
