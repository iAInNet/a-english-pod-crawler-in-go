## Dialogue
Mr. Parsons:  Okay, now I'd like to find out more about your last job. I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right? 

Rebecca:  Yes, that's right. To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me. I was really just treated more like an intern. I didn't have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating. 

Mr. Parsons:  So, what changed? 

Rebecca:  Well slowly but surely I proved myself, and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . 

Mr. Parsons:  Wow, a real step up! 

Rebecca:  Yes I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly. I spent restaurant  years in that position, but to be honest it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term. 

Mr. Parsons:  I see, so why did you decide to leave finally? 

Rebecca:  I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities. I really needed a more challenging role to be honest.
