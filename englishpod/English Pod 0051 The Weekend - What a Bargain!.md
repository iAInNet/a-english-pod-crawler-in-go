## Dialogue
A:  Hello. May I help you?

B:  Yeah,   this dress is really nice!  How much is it?

A:  That one is one hundred and fifty dollars.

B:  One hundred and fifty dollars? What about this other one over here?

A:  That's one hundred and forty dollars.

B:  Hmm...that's a bit out of my price range.    Can you give me a better deal?

A:  This is an exclusive design by DaMarco! It's a bargain at that price.

B:  Well, I don't know. I think I'll shop around.

A:  Okay,  okay, how about one hundred dollars?

B:  That's still more than I wanted to spend. What if I take both dresses?

A:  Okay, I can give you a special discount, just because you seem like a nice person. One hundred and ninety dollars for both.

B:  I don't know... It's still a bit pricey.... Thanks anyway.

A:  Okay,   my final price! One hundred dollars for both! That's two for the price of one. That's my last offer!

B:  Great! You've got a deal!
