## Dialogue
A:  ...like I told you before, we just don't have the resources to hire you an assistant.

B:  I understand that, but the fact is we're   understaffed.

A:  The timing is just not right.  The economy is bad, and it's too  risky  to take on  new staff.

B:  Yeah, I guess you're   right.... here's an idea, what if we hire an intern?  She would take some of the weight off my shoulders.

A:  She?

B:  Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could give me a hand with some of these projects  and we could keep our costs down.

A:  That sounds reasonable...  let me see   what I can do.

A:  Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.

B:  OK, great! Let's  meet her!

C:  Hi, I'm Adam.

B:  Oh... hi... I'm Tony...
