## Dialogue
A:  Hello sir, how can I help you?

B:  Yes, I need this prescription please.

A:  Let's see. Okay, so 50 mg of Prozac, would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?

B:  Capsules are fine.

A:  Okay, you should take 1 capsule  3 times a day. Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach, and also, don't ever mix it with alcohol!

B:  Yes, I know. It's not the first time I'm taking this! Don't worry, I won't overdose!

A:  Okay, anything else I can get you?

B:  Oh,  yes, I almost forgot! Can I also get some eye drops and um, some condoms?

A:  Sure. Darn   condoms aren't registered in our system.

B:  Oh, well that's okay, I'll get some later,   thanks... Really it's no problem.

A:  Just hang on there a sec. Can I get a price check on " Fun Times Ribbed Condoms" please!
