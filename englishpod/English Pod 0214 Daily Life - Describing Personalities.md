## Dialogue
A:  OK class, settle down. I have the results of your individual personality tests. I am going to hand them out and if you'dlike, you can read them out loud to the rest of the class. 

B:  I'll read mine! 

A:  OK, go ahead. 

B:  It says here that I am adventurous, outgoing and easy-going. It says that I am a little superstitious and occasionally naive! That's not true! 

A:  The test isn't one-hundred percent accurate.  Is that all it says? 

B:  No! It also says that I am open-minded with great ambition but that I can also be reckless and clumsy. This is stupid! 

A:  Ok, anyone else want to read theirs? 

C:  I'll go! It says that I am an extroverted, well-balanced person. It says I am generous, outspoken, and very diligent. This is so true! It also says that I am magnanimous, eloquent and daring! This is totally me! 

A:  Pfft whatever, these tests are bologna!
