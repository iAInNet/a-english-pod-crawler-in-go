## Dialogue
A:  Why didn’t you text me last night? 

B:  What? I sent you three or four messages! 

A:  I didn’t get any of them. I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message. 

B:  Why didn’t you just call? I hate sending SMS messages. 

A:  Well, because I didn’t have any credit on my phone. I used it all up  this month. 

B:  I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan? 

A:  I do, but if I don’t have any credit in my phone, it won’t let me call or send messages. 

B:  No wonder you didn’t get my texts!
