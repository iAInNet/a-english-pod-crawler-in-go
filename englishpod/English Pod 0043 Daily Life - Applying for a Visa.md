## Dialogue
A:  So,    you're  applying   for  a  B2  visa,   where   is  your  final  destination  and  what's  the   purpose  of  your    trip   to  the  United States?

B:  I'm   going  to visit  my  brother;   he's  just  had  a  baby.    He  lives   in  Minneapolis.

A:  And   how long  do you  you   plan  to remain   in  the  United States?

B:  I'll  be  here  for  approximately   three  weeks.   See,   here's  my return ticket for   the  twenty-sixth of March.

A:  And,  who   is sponsoring   your  trip?

B:  My  brother,   here,   this   is  an invitation  letter   from  him.   I  will stay  with  him   and  his  family  in their  home.

A:  Alright,   tell  me  about  the  ties   you  have  to   your  home country.

B:  Well,   I   own   a  house;   actually,   I'm  leaving my  dog   there    with  my neighbors.   I  have  a  car   at   home,  and  oh,   my  job!   I'm  employed by   Tornel   as  an  engineer.   Actually,   I  only  have  three  weeks'  vacation,   so I  have  to go back   to   work  at  the   end   of  March.

A:  And   what evidence  do  you  have   that    you  are  financially independent?

B:  Well,   I   do  have   assets  in   my  country;   like  I  said,   I  own  a    house,   and  see,   here's  a  bank statement  showing  my   investments,   and  my   bank balance.

A:  I'm  sorry,   sir,    we  cannot grant   you  a  B2  visa   at this time,    instead,   you  are   granted  a   resident visa!    Congratulations,   you   are   the   millionth  person   to apply  for   a  visa!    You   win!    Congratulations!
