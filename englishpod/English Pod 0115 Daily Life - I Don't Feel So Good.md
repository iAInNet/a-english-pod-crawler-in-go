## Dialogue
A:  Are you okay, man?  You don't look very well.

B:  Ugh, I feel terrible.  I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

A:  Nice! So, where did you guys go?

B:  We hit a couple of local bars, and met up with some friends.  Everything was cool until Mike came along, and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday!

A:  Oh no! Mike's birthday is a drinkfest for sure!

B:  Tell me about it! We drank everything in the bar!

A:  Is that why you missed work today?

B:  Yeah. I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.  I threw up like five times.

A:  Eww!

B:  I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water, and my head has been pounding all day.  I swear, I'm never gonna drink again!

A:  Too bad man, tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were gonna go.

B:  Oh, yeah.  I'm there!
