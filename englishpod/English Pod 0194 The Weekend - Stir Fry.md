## Dialogue
A:  Oh, man. I had the best supper last night. My wife made a stir fry and it was amazing! 

B:  I love stir fry Crispy bite-sized vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce. Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts. Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger! Mmm! Mmm! It's almost lunchtime. I would die for a plate of stir fry right now! 

A:  Well, you can keep the vegetables, I'll take the meat. The stir fry my wife made was really hearty, with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion... 

B:  What? You call that a stir fry? More meat than vegetables? That's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap! Silly Americans!
