## Dialogue
A:  Oh,  Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation!  It's really very nice of you to invite    us over for dinner, don't you think so, Ellen?

B:  Oh, yes of course!  We'd  love to come over.    Can I bring anything?

C:  No, don't  worry about it; I'll   take care  of everything. I'll  see you tonight. Come with an appetite... I know I will!

B:  I don't    want   go over  to his place for dinner! He gives me the creeps!   Why on earth  did you accept?

A:  Oh come on  Ellen, it will be nice to get to know  him. Besides, he's  new to the neighborhood, and it would    be  rude  to decline his  invitation.

B:  I guess so...   You always rope me into things like this!

C:  Ladies! Thank you for coming! You look delicious...   I mean beautiful. Please come in.

A:  Oh Oh Armand! You are too kind!

B:  How did I get myself into this...
