## Dialogue
A:  Are you excited about your trip next month?

B:  Yes and no.  I can’t wait to go to Europe, but at the same time I am terrified.

A:  Why?

B:  Well, I have aerophobia. I have a chronic fear of flying.

A:  Oh really? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying. It’s not that bad though, I mean, it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour. I actually have arachnophobia. 

B:  You’re scared of spiders?  I actually have two more phobias.  Acrophobia and glossophobia.

A:  I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying, but public speaking is not that bad.

B:  Are you kidding?  When I get on stage, my palms start to sweat, I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.

A:  Well, I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic. I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds.

B:  We are such weirdos right?
