## Dialogue
A:  Did you read this? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family. 

B:  Why would that be funny? 

A:  Well, think about it. We are a society that is always on the go, not because we have to, but because we want to. 

B:  Why? 

A:  We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary. 

B:  I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a new year's resolution yourself. 

A:  What's the point? We always make a new year's resolution and by February we will have  forgotten about it. It's pointless. 

B:  Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives. 

A:  What about you? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in. 

B:  Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going tothe gym with me everyday! 

A:  Yeah yeah whatever.
