## Dialogue
A:  What did you cook? 

B:  Well, as you know I was in Thailand last month, and I took a cooking class! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes. 

A:  Great idea! As long as I don’t get food poisoning! So what is onthe menu tonight? 

B:  Ok, for starters we have Tom Yam soup. It’s a bit spicy, but really good! 

A:  This is delicious! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste! 

B:  Now this next dish is one of the most famous.  Foreigners call it papaya salad butthe proper name is Tom Sam.  It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato. 

A:  This is delicious! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting!  I could have this everyday! 

B:  Ok, now forthe last and best dish in my opinion. This is called Pad Thai. It’s stir-fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper plus bean sprouts, shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander. It’s practically Thailand’s national dish! 

A:  Wow, this is great! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious! 

B:  Wantsome more? 

A:  I’m stuffed!
