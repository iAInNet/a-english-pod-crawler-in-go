## Dialogue
A:  I'm so  excited  about Chinese New Year!  When do I get to visit Grandma? Grandma makes the best dumplings  in the world!

B:  Ha ha, right. Sounds to me like you're  more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma.

A:  Of course  I miss Grandma, too. I bet she's  gonna teach me how to play Mahjong! Hey, Dad, are you going to buy me firecrackers this year? We're  going to have the best fireworks! I'm  really  looking forward to    lighting them!

B:  Son, firecrackers aren't  toys; they're  dangerous!

A:  No,  fireworks are awesome!

B:  Whoa, don't  you remember? Last year when I set off the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother?

A:  Dad! I was scared because... because I saw a bug. That's  all.

B:  Hahaha... really?

A:  Oh, and I can't  wait to watch the   dragon dance!  Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

B:  Hey, I offered last year...

A:  Well, I... anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes. I wanna make a list of all the things I'm gonna buy  with my red envelope money!  I can't  wait! I'm gonna have so much money!  Mom, can I get a pen and a piece  of  paper?

A:  I want a new transformer, no, two transformers...the Optimus Prime, and...maybe the wheeljack? I'll  get a    PSP game, hahaha, and I'll  buy the entire class lunch at MacDonald's...
