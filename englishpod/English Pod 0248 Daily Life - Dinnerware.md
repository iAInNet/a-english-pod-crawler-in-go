## Dialogue
A:  Honey can you set the table? 

B:  Um, sure. What are we having for dinner? Do I need to put out anything in particular? 

A:  Well, make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers. I don't know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case. 

B:  Ok, should I use the fancy silverware? 

A:  Yeah go ahead, forks, spoons and knives.  I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well. 

B:  I'll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner. 

A:  Honey? Have you seen our soup bowls? 

B:  They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes. Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there. 

A:  Oops!
