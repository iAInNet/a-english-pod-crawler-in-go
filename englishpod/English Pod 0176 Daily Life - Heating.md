## Dialogue
A:  It's freezing in here! Can I turn up the heat? 

B:  Don't touch that thermostat! You don't paythe bills around here! 

A:  Dad! Are you serious? What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it! Look, I can see my breath! 

B:  Put on a sweater! I'm not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly. 

A:  Dad! I'm gonna catch a cold! 

B:  When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do! We had a furnace inthe center ofthe living room and that was it. We used it to cook, heat the house and even dry our clothes! We never caught a cold. You should be grateful!
