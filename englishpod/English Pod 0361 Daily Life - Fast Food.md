## Dialogue
A:  I’m hungry, let’s order up something to eat. 

B:  Ok, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street. 

A:  I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries and a chocolate sundae. 

B:  You eat too much junk food. That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol. 

A:  Well I never seem to gain weight so I don’t mind. 

B:  It’s not only about getting fat or not, it’s about being healthy. You could really have some health problems later on. 

A:  How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken! Better yet, let’s order some hot dogs! 

B:  You are a lost cause.
