## Dialogue
A:  Hi Daniel, how are you holding up? I am greatly sorry for your loss. 

B:  Thank you, I'm doing much better. I've begun organizing everything for the funeral. 

A:  How's that going ?

B:  It's a lot harder than I imagined. There are many things that you have to to arrange. I booked a time and date with the funeral home, but I still have a lot of things to do. 

A:  Have you bought a burial plot and a casket? 

B:  No. Wendy is being cremated. She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried.  I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean. 

A:  I see, that sounds like something she would have really liked. I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful. You are doing a great job. 

B:  Thanks, it hasn't been easy, but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters.
