## Dialogue
Salesperson:  Hello there, welcome to Wine World. Let me know if I can help you out at all. 

Customer:  Um, yes, please, I could really use some help. I’m going over to my boss’ house for dinner tonight and don’t know what kind of wine I should bring. 

Salesperson:  OK, do you know what kind of food will be served? 

Customer:  Well, his wife is Japanese. He said she makes really good sushi. 

Salesperson:  Hmm, that’s a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let’s see. have to be a white wine, of course. 

Customer:  Why? Wouldn’t a red wine go well with sushi? 

Salesperson:  No, I don’t think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish. 

Customer:  I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That’s a white wine, right? 

Salesperson:  Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I’m not sure it’d be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I’d suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

Customer:  Sauvignon Blanc? What’s that?

Salesperson:  That’s another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

Customer:  Let’s see. The label says it’s got "attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a bone-dry finish. Serve chilled." Oh, no, how long will it take to chill the wine? I’m on my way to the dinner now.

Salesperson:  It’s OK, don’t worry, we’ll just choose a wine from the cooler. We don’t have quite as extensive a selection over here, but...this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.

Customer:  All right. What varietal is that?

Salesperson:  Well, this is a French wine, so they don’t always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I’d guess.

Customer:  And you think this is a good wine?

Salesperson:  Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It’s not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it’s more approachable. It’s light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

Customer:  Perfect! I’ll take it!
