## Dialogue
A:  Hello Mrs Parker, how have you been?

B:  Hello Dr Peters.  Just fine thank you.  Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.

A:  Very well.  Let’s see, according to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his Polio, Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots.  He is 14 months old, so he is due for Hepatitis A, Chickenpox and Measles shots.

B:  What about Rubella and Mumps?

A:  Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest.

B:  Ok great.  Doctor, I think I also may need a Tetanus booster.  Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago!

A:  We will check our records and I’ll have the nurse administer the booster as well.  Now, please hold Ricky’s arm tight, this may sting a little.
