## Dialogue
A:  Alright, so the first thing that you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that line where the lane begins. 

B:  Why not?

A:  Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down.  If you step there you will slip and fall.

A:  OK, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our names on the scorecard, so now, how the heck do I play this?

A:  You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.  If you do, that is called a strike.  If you don’t knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare. After ten frames, we add up the points and see who has the most. Three hundred is a perfect score, but very hard to get.

B:  Got it!  OK, I’m gonna give it a go.  Oh no!  My ball went in the gutter!

A:  I told you, its harder than you think.  Now let a pro show you how it’s done.
