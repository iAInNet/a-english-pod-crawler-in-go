## Dialogue
Mr. Campbell:  Ah Michelle hi. I was hoping to see you. How have you been? How's the family? 

Michelle:  Oh hello Mr. Campbell. I'm fine and Jack's doing well. How are you? 

Mr. Campbell:  I'm fine thanks. I got your report this morning. Thank's for that. Are you joining the conference today?

Michelle:  Yes, I'm leaving at four pm.

Mr Campbell:  Good, well we can discuss this more then, but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter.

Michelle:  Yes, me too.

Mr Campbell:  I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference. I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising.

Michelle:  No, me neither. It's far too expensive.

Mr. Campbell:  Well, let's discuss this more at the conference. Maybe we can share a taxi there.

Michelle:  Yes, sure.
