## Dialogue
James:  So Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria. She's my colleague from Brazil. Maria, this is Michelle. 

Maria:  Hi Michelle. So what do you do here in Shanghai? I mean, what work do you do? 

Michelle:  I work in advertising right now. How about you? 

Maria:  I'm actually inthe wine business. 

Michelle:  That sounds really great. I love wine myself! Is this your first time to Shanghai Maria? 

Maria:  No actually, I often visit. I usually come to China for business at least once a year. Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai, so that's a good reason to come. 

Michelle:  Me too. Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend. I mean, the food is delicious butthe service isn't so good. I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there. 

James:  We should go together some time. 

Michelle:  Wonderful idea! I'd love that!
