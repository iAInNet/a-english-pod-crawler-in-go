## Dialogue
A:  Where to, miss?

B:  Hi!  Crenshaw and Hawthorne, at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.

A:  Sure thing.  So, where are you flying in from?

B:  From China.

A:  Really?  You don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so.

B:  It's fine.  I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.

A:  Wow sounds interesting!  Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, how old are you?

B:  Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

A:  Don't get me wrong! It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas!

B:  Well thank you! In that case, I am 26 years old, and what about yourself?

A:  I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U.S of A, although I have some Colombian heritage.

B:  Really? That's great!  Do you speak some Spanish?

A:  Uh... yeah.. of course!

B:  Que bien! Entonces podemos hablar en espanol!
