## Dialogue
A:  Hello   everyone!    I'm  Rick Fields,   and  here  with  me  is  Bob Copeland.

B:  Howdy  folks,   and  welcome to  today's  game!    You know,  Rick,    today  is    a   key   game   between   Russia   and  Canada.    As you know,   the  winner   will move on   to  the finals.

A:  That's right,   and  it looks like  we're   just about  ready   to start  the  match.    The  ref    is calling  the  players  for the  face-off... and  here  we  go!   The   Russians  win possession  and  immediately  set up  their  attack!    Federov  gets  checked  hard  into  the  boards!

B:  Maurice Richard has  the  puck  now,   and  passes   it  to  the center.   He  shoots!   Wow  what a  save  by  the   goalie!

A:  Alright,    the   puck  is  back in play   now.  Pavel Bure  is  on  a breakaway!    He  is flying  down  the ice!   The  defenders   can't  keep up!   Slap shot!   He  scores

B:  What an    amazing  goal!
