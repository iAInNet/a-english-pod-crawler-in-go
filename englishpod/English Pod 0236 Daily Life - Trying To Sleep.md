## Dialogue
Jill:  Alex, what's up with you? You look dreadful! 

Alex:  Hey Jill, I don't know. I've been having trouble sleeping these past few weeks. I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep . I've tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to bed . I've tried eating and not eating different foods. I've even tried counting sheep! And then when I finally get to sleep , I have these really disturbing nightmares, so I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep . 

Jill:  Wow, maybe you should get that checked out. Maybe you're stressed? 

C:  Just take some sedatives! Works for me! Every so often having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping . It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders . It's the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns . 

Jill:  I heard of that. But does that apply to Alex's situation? 

C:  Ya sure, why not ? Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since it's a recent thing so taking melatonin do the trick. 

Jill:  But shouldn't he be looking into WHY it's been happening? 

C:  Well aren't youthe little psychologist? Our buddy's having trouble sleeping , it's easy and curable. It's not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker. 

Alex:  Well, there's that too.
