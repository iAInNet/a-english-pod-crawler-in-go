B:  Ok, so what do you wanther to do? 

A:  Well, let’s see. I wanther to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom and maybe do some cooking. 

B:  Got it. And how much do you offer per month? 

A:  I would pay her hourly, I don’t know what the going rate   is though.
