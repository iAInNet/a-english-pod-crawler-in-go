## Dialogue
A:  Whoa,  whoa, what's going on?  Watch out!

B:  Hey,  watch where you're going!

A:  Oh,  no!  I'm so sorry!  Are you all right?

B:  Oh...I don't know.

A:  I feel terrible,  I really  didn't mean to knock you over.  My tire,  just exploded,  and  I lost  control  of my bike.  Really,  it was  an accident.   Please accept my apologies.

B:  Just let  me try to stand up.

SONG:  Why do birds suddenly appear,  every time you are near?

A:  Are you okay?

B:  Oh,  wait a second,  you seem really familiar,  I think I know you  from   somewhere.

A:  Yeah,  I think we have met  somewhere before.  That's right!  We met at  Aaron's  place last weekend!  What a coincidence!   But anyway,  I'm glad to see  that you're not too badly hurt,  and I should probably  get going.  I have a nine o'clock meeting.  

B:  Ouch! My ankle!  I think it's broken!  You can't just  leave me like this!  Are you calling an ambulance?

A:  Nope,  I'm canceling my appointment  so that I can stay here with you.

SONG:  Do you remember when we met?  That's the day I  knew you were my pet.  I wanna tell you how much I love you.
