## Dialogue
A:  Why did your girlfriend break up with you? 

B:  I don’t know, she said she was tired of me not manning up  and being more independent, which I think is all a bunch of crap. 

A:  Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point. 

B:  What do you mean?  Lots of people live with their parents, especially when rent isso expensive andthe slump inthe economy. 

A:  Yeah, but you are almost forty! Plus, you make good money so there is really no excuse. It’s simply because you are a momma's boy. 

B:  Whatever dude, I have everything I need, why would I move out! Have a great roof over my head, my mom does my laundry and cooks for me, what else could a guy ask for! 

A:  Let’s agree to disagree.
