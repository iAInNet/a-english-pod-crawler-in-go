## Dialogue
Mr. Parsons:  Okay, well I'm sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position. 

Rebecca:  Yes, well Miss Childs did give me an overview of the position over the phone, but there were some details I'd like to clarify. 

Mr. Parsons:  Well feel free to ask me anything, and I'll try to fill in the details.

Rebecca:  Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?

Mr. Parsons:  Yes of course. That's quite an important point isn't it?  As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of  150,000 HK dollars per annum. This doesn't include a generous housing allowance also. 

Rebecca:  I understand. And are there other bonuses included? 

Mr. Parsons:  Well apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers. But we could go through all the details of that at a later date. 

Rebecca:  Well Mr. Parsons, I am flexible when it comes to salary. The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me. 

Mr. Parsons:  Excellent. Well, what other questions do you have Rebecca?
