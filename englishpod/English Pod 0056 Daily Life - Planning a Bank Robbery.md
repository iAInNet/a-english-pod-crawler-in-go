## Dialogue
A:  All right, so this is what we are going to do. I've carefully mapped this out, so don't screw it up.  Mr. Rabbit, you and Mr. Fox  will go  into the bank wearing these uniforms.  We managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear when they pick up the money.

B:  Got it.

C:  No problem, boss.

A:  When you get inside, tell them that you are filling in for Carl and Tom, and say that they are on another route today.  Don't lose your cool. Just act natural.

B:  What if they want to call and confirm?

A:  You let him.

C:  What!?

A:  Don’t worry, we have the phones tapped, so the call will be patched through to me, and I’ll pretend to be the transport company.

B:  Ha ha,   you are so clever boss!

A:  Okay, shut  up. Only take as much money as you can fit in these bags.  Don’t get greedy!  Are you ready? Let's go.
