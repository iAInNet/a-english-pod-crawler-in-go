## Dialogue
A:  Hey Julie, you want to go grab something to eat? 

B:  Sure! What do you feel like having? 

A:  I really feel like having a big juicy steak! 

B:  Oh. ok. I don’t eat meat, but that’s fine, I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right? 

A:  I didn’t know you were a vegetarian! 

B:  I’m not, I am a vegan. 

A:  A what? 

B:  A vegan. I don’t eat or use any animal based products. I don’t wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from an animal. I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don’t eat meat, but still have fish and seafood. 

A:  Wow! That’s interesting! It must be tough! 

B:  It’s a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians  or vegans  nowadays, it’s getting a bit less difficult.
